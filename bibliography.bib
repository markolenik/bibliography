                  the properties of network components. Using a combination of

  abstract        = {Robustness is an essential feature of biological systems,
                  and any mathematical model that describes such a system should
                  reflect this feature. Especially, persistence of oscillatory
                  behavior is an important issue. A benchmark model for this
                  phenomenon is the Laub-Loomis model, a nonlinear model for
                  cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum. This model
                  captures the most important features of biomolecular networks
                  oscillating at constant frequencies. Nevertheless, the
                  robustness of its oscillatory behavior is not yet fully
                  understood. Given a system that exhibits oscillating behavior
                  for some set of parameters, the central question of robustness
                  is how far the parameters may be changed, such that the
                  qualitative behavior does not change. The determination of
                  such a “robustness region” in parameter space is an intricate
                  task. If the number of parameters is high, it may be also time
                  consuming. In the literature, several methods are proposed
                  that partially tackle this problem. For example, some methods
                  only detect particular bifurcations, or only find a relatively
                  small box-shaped estimate for an irregularly shaped robustness
                  region. Here, we present an approach that is much more
                  general, and is especially designed to be efficient for
                  systems with a large number of parameters. As an illustration,
                  we apply the method first to a well understood low-dimensional
                  system, the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. This is a
                  predator-prey model featuring satiation of the predator. It
                  has only two parameters and its bifurcation diagram is
                  available in the literature. We find a good agreement with the
                  existing knowledge about this model. When we apply the new
                  method to the high dimensional Laub-Loomis model, we obtain a
                  much larger robustness region than reported earlier in the
                  literature. This clearly demonstrates the power of our method.
                  From the results, we conclude that the biological system
                  underlying is much more robust than was realized until now.},

                  Vertex Model to study the mechanics of confluent epithelial
                  tissues and cell monolayers. The model combines the commonly
                  used Vertex Model for describing epithelial tissue mechanics
                  with the active matter dynamics extensively studied in soft
                  matter physics. We utlise an exact mathematical mapping that
                  enables a very efficient numerical implementation using
                  standard methods for simulating particle-based models. System
                  sizes accessible to this model allow us to probe the dynamical
                  motion patterns that occur in tissues over a range of length-
                  and time-scales previously inaccessible to available
                  simulation tools. Our model also includes a number of
                  essential features required to properly describe actual
                  biological systems such as cell growth, cell division and
                  aptotsis, as well as the dynamic boundary of the epithelial
                  sheet. This allows us to study phenomena such as the
                  finger-like protrusions in cell monolayers and processes
                  related to wound healing. The model is implemented into the
                  SAMoS simulation software package and is publically available
                  under a non-restrictive open source licence.},

                  exhibit features of glassy dynamics, such as caging behavior
                  and dynamical heterogeneities, although it has remained
                  unclear how single-cell properties control this behavior. Here
                  we develop numerical and theoretical models to calculate
                  energy barriers to cell rearrangements, which help govern cell
                  migration in cell monolayers. In contrast to work on sheared
                  foams, we find that energy barrier heights are exponentially
                  distributed and depend systematically on the cell's number of
                  neighbors. Based on these results, we predict glassy two-time
                  correlation functions for cell motion, with a timescale that
                  increases rapidly as cell activity decreases. These
                  correlation functions are used to construct simple random
                  walks that reproduce the caging behavior observed for cell
                  trajectories in experiments. This work provides a theoretical
                  framework for predicting collective motion of cells in
                  wound-healing, embryogenesis and cancer tumorogenesis.},

  note            = {1. The ionic currents in the lateral pyloric (LP) cell of
                  the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) described in the preceding
                  paper of the rock crab Cancer borealis were fit with a set of
                  differential equations that describe their voltage, time, and
                  Ca2+ dependence. The voltage-dependent currents modeled are a
                  delayed rectifier-like current, id; a Ca(2+)-activated outward
                  current, io(Ca); a transient A-like current, iA; a Ca2+
                  current, iCa; an inwardly rectifying current, ih; and a fast
                  tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ current, iNa. 2. A
                  single-compartment, isopotential model of the LP cell was
                  constructed from the six voltage-dependent currents, a
                  voltage-independent leak current il, a Ca2+ buffering system,
                  and the membrane capacitance. 3. The behavior of the model LP
                  neuron was compared with that of the biological neuron by
                  simulating physiological experiments carried out in both
                  voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes. The model and
                  biological neurons show similar action-potential shapes,
                  durations, steady-state current-voltage (I-V) curves, and
                  respond to injected current in a comparable way.},

  abstract        = {The minimal ``integrate-and-fire-or-burst'' (IFB) neuron
                  model reproduces the salient features of experimentally
                  observed thalamocortical relay neuron response properties,
                  including the temporal tuning of both tonic spiking (i.e.,
                  conventional action potentials) and post-inhibitory rebound
                  bursting mediated by the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT. In
                  previous work focusing on experimental and IFB model responses
                  to sinusoidal current injection, large regions of stimulus
                  parameter space were observed for which the response was
                  entrained to periodic applied current, resulting in repetitive
                  burst, tonic, or mixed (i.e., burst followed by tonic)
                  responses. Here we present an exact analysis of such
                  mode-locking in the integrate-and-fire-or-burst model under
                  the influence of arbitrary periodic forcing that includes
                  sinusoidally driven responses as one case. In this analysis,
                  the instabilities of mode-locked states are identified as both
                  smooth bifurcations of an associated firing time map and
                  nonsmooth bifurcations of the underlying discontinuous flow.
                  The explicit construction of borders in parameter space that
                  define the instabilities of mode-locked zones is used to build
                  up the Arnol'd tongue structure for the model. The zones for
                  mode-locking are shown to be in excellent agreement with
                  numerical simulations and are used to explore the observed

  abstract        = {The minimal integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neuron model
                  reproduces the salient features of experimentally observed
                  thalamocortical (TC) relay neuron response properties,
                  including the temporal tuning of both tonic spiking (i.e.,
                  conventional action potentials) and postinhibitory rebound
                  bursting mediated by a low-threshold calcium current. In this
                  paper we consider networks of IFB neurons with slow synaptic
                  interactions and show how the dynamics may be described with a
                  smooth firing-rate model. When the firing rate of the IFB
                  model is dominated by a refractory process the equations of
                  motion simplify and may be solved exactly. Numerical
                  simulations are used to show that a pair of reciprocally
                  interacting inhibitory spiking IFB TC neurons supports an
                  alternating rhythm of the type predicted from the firing-rate
                  theory. A change in a single parameter of the IFB neuron
                  allows it to fire a burst of spikes in response to a
                  depolarizing signal, so that it mimics the behavior of a
                  reticular (RE) cell. Within a continuum model we show that a
                  network of RE cells with on-center excitation can support a
                  fast traveling pulse. In contrast, a network of inhibitory TC
                  cells is found to support a slowly propagating lurching
                  pulse.},

                  the medicinal leech is based on the alternating bursting of
                  mutually inhibitory pairs of oscillator heart interneurons
                  (half-center oscillators). Bicuculline methiodide has been
                  shown to block mutual inhibition between these interneurons
                  and to cause them to spike tonically while recorded
                  intracellularly (Schmidt and Calabrese, 1992). Using
                  extracellular recording techniques, we show here that
                  oscillator and premotor heart interneurons continue to burst
                  when pharmacologically isolated with bicuculline, although the
                  bursting is not robust in some preparations. We propose that a
                  nonspecific leak current introduced by the intracellular
                  microelectrode suppresses endogenous bursting activity to
                  account for the discrepancy with results using intracellular
                  recording. A two-parameter bifurcation diagram (E leak vsg
                  leak) of a mathematical model of a single heart interneuron
                  shows a narrow stripe of parameter values where bursting
                  occurs, separating large zones of tonic spiking and silence. A
                  similar analysis performed for a half-center oscillator model
                  outlined a much larger area of bursting. Bursting in the
                  half-center oscillator model is also less sensitive to
                  variation in the maximal conductances of voltage-gated
                  currents than in the single-neuron model. Thus, in addition to
                  ensuring appropriate bursting characteristics such as period,
                  phase, and duty cycles, the half-center configuration enhances
                  oscillation robustness, making them less susceptible to random
                  or imposed changes in membrane parameters. Endogenous
                  bursting, in turn, ensures appropriate bursting if the
                  strength of mutual inhibition is weakened and limits the
                  minimum period of the half-center oscillator to a period near
                  that of the single neuron.},

                  motor centres during swimming in the paralysed Xenopus embryo
                  has been investigated further. Paired intracellular recordings
                  have been made from interneurones and motoneurones in an
                  attempt to identify neurones which make direct inhibitory
                  synapses onto motoneurones on the opposite side of the spinal
                  cord. A physiological class of inhibitory interneurones is
                  described which, when stimulated by intracellular current
                  passage, evoke short-latency, probably monosynaptic,
                  strychnine-sensitive inhibitory potentials in contralateral
                  motoneurones. These inhibitory interneurones fire once per
                  swimming cycle in phase with the ipsilateral motor root
                  discharge. They therefore have a pattern of activity which
                  would cause them to inhibit motoneurones of the antagonistic
                  motor centre at an appropriate part of the swimming cycle. The
                  intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has
                  allowed the morphology of these inhibitory interneurones to be
                  characterized. They have unipolar cell bodies with a thick
                  proximal process with short dendrites which crosses the spinal
                  cord ventrally and then bifurcates with one axonal branch
                  ascending into the hind brain and the other descending the
                  spinal cord. These anatomical features are typical of the
                  'commissural interneurones' first described by Roberts \&
                  Clarke (1982). There are also some inhibitory interneurones
                  which can inhibit motoneurones on the same side of the spinal
                  cord. At least some of these interneurones may be commissural
                  interneurones with ipsilateral axons and they may play a role
                  in the generation of the swimming rhythm.},

  abstract        = {1. Neurons from the Xenopus embryo spinal cord were
                  dissociated and conventional patch clamp techniques were used
                  to record the whole-cell currents in the presence of
                  tetrodotoxin (TTX). 2. The outward currents of the acutely
                  isolated spinal neurons were rapidly reduced to about half
                  their control value by substitution of extracellular Na+ with
                  N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine or choline. 3. The use of Li+ as
                  a Na+ substitute partially reduced the outward currents. 4.
                  The reversal potential of the Na(+)-sensitive current was
                  close to the K+ equilibrium potential and could be altered by
                  changing extracellular K+. The Na(+)-sensitive current was
                  therefore a K+ current. 5. The Na(+)-sensitive K+ current was
                  voltage dependent and activated in a sustained manner and
                  appeared very similar to the delayed rectifier present in
                  these neurons. 6. While the Na(+)-sensitive current increased
                  with voltage as might be expected for an outward current, at
                  very positive potentials it progressively decreased in
                  amplitude. The voltage range over which this decrease was
                  present moved closer to zero as the levels of intracellular
                  Na+ were increased. The tail currents evoked by positive test
                  potentials did not correspondingly decrease in amplitude,
                  suggesting that channel block was rapidly relieved by stepping
                  back to the holding potential. 7. Intracellular perfusion of
                  the patch pipette with solutions containing varying amounts of
                  Na+ (0-20 mM) showed that the K+ currents could be increased
                  in a dose-dependent manner by raising intracellular Na+. The
                  current had an EC50 for Na+ of 7.3 mM and a Hill coefficient
                  of 4.6. 8. Single channel recordings from isolated inside-out
                  patches revealed a channel that gated more frequently when the
                  bathing levels of Na+ were elevated from 3 to 12 or 50 mM.
                  Xenopus spinal cord neurons therefore possess a current that
                  is not only voltage dependent but is also sensitive to
                  internal Na+. 9. Xenopus spinal neurons possess a transient
                  Na+ current (blocked by the inclusion of TTX) and a leak
                  channel permeable to Na+. The inward leakage of Na+ appeared
                  to provide the Na+ necessary for the gating of the
                  Na(+)-dependent channel. 10. Blocking the Na(+)-K+ exchange
                  pumps by removing extracellular K+, reduced the effect of
                  removal of external Na+, suggesting that the Na(+)-K+ exchange
                  pumps could be important in controlling the submembrane
                  Na+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

                  under a common abstract framework and establishes selected
                  general properties of the associated near-grazing dynamics. In
                  particular, it is shown that for critical choices of parameter
                  values, commonly used physical models of rigid or compliant
                  mechanical contact, capillary adhesion, and cell division
                  satisfy the conditions required by the general framework. The
                  paper relies on the well-known discontinuity-mapping
                  formalism. In contrast to previous treatments, the proposed
                  abstract framework more clearly establishes the origin of the
                  large state-space stretching in the initial (and possibly
                  only) step of the construction of a discontinuity mapping. It
                  further highlights the nonuniqueness in the formulation of the
                  discontinuity mapping and its connection to the choice of a
                  locally smooth map with which the discontinuity mapping is

                  demands, manifested as changes in oscillation period or in
                  relative phase durations in response to variations in
                  non-patterned inputs or drives. Although many half-center CPG
                  models, composed of symmetric units linked by reciprocal
                  inhibition yet varying in their intrinsic cellular properties,
                  have been proposed, the precise oscillatory mechanisms
                  operating in most biological CPGs remain unknown. Using
                  numerical simulations and phase-plane analysis, we
                  comparatively investigated how the intrinsic cellular features
                  incorporated in different CPG models, such as subthreshold
                  activation based on a slowly inactivating persistent sodium
                  current, adaptation based on slowly activating
                  calcium-dependent potassium current, or post-inhibitory
                  rebound excitation, can contribute to the control of
                  oscillation period and phase durations in response to changes
                  in excitatory external drive to one or both half-centers. Our
                  analysis shows that both the sensitivity of oscillation period
                  to alterations of excitatory drive and the degree to which the
                  duration of each phase can be separately controlled depend
                  strongly on the intrinsic cellular mechanisms involved in
                  rhythm generation and phase transitions. In particular, the
                  CPG formed from units incorporating a slowly inactivating
                  persistent sodium current shows the greatest range of
                  oscillation periods and the greatest degree of independence in
                  phase duration control by asymmetric inputs. These results are
                  explained based on geometric analysis of the phase plane
                  structures corresponding to the dynamics for each CPG type,
                  which in particular helps pinpoint the roles of escape and
                  release from synaptic inhibition in the effects we find.},

                  software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with
                  both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each
                  simulator uses its own programming or configuration language,
                  leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one
                  simulator to another. This impedes communication between
                  investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on
                  the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can
                  be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater
                  confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has
                  different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can
                  be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming
                  interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the
                  problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits.
                  PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a
                  simulation script once, using the Python programming language,
                  and run it without modification on any supported simulator
                  (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI
                  neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of
                  neuronal network modelling by providing high-level
                  abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by
                  providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis,
                  visualization and data-management tools. PyNN increases the
                  reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to
                  check results on multiple simulators. PyNN is open-source

  abstract        = {Working memory refers to the temporary retention of
                  information that was just experienced or just retrieved from
                  long-term memory but no longer exists in the external
                  environment. These internal representations are short-lived,
                  but can be stored for longer periods of time through active
                  maintenance or rehearsal strategies, and can be subjected to
                  various operations that manipulate the information in such a
                  way that makes it useful for goal-directed behaviour.
                  Empirical studies of working memory using neuroscientific
                  techniques, such as neuronal recordings in monkeys or
                  functional neuroimaging in humans, have advanced our knowledge
                  of the underlying neural mechanisms of working memory. This
                  rich dataset can be reconciled with behavioural findings
                  derived from investigating the cognitive mechanisms underlying
                  working memory. In this paper, I review the progress that has
                  been made towards this effort by illustrating how
                  investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying working
                  memory can be influenced by cognitive models and, in turn, how
                  cognitive models can be shaped and modified by neuroscientific
                  data. One conclusion that arises from this research is that
                  working memory can be viewed as neither a unitary nor a
                  dedicated system. A network of brain regions, including the
                  prefrontal cortex (PFC), is critical for the active
                  maintenance of internal representations that are necessary for
                  goal-directed behaviour. Thus, working memory is not localized
                  to a single brain region but probably is an emergent property
                  of the functional interactions between the PFC and the rest of
                  the brain.},

  abstract        = {1. The oscillatory properties of the isolated reticular
                  (RE) thalamus were modeled with the use of compartmental
                  models of RE cells. Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetic models of
                  ionic channels were derived from voltage- and current-clamp
                  data from RE cells. Interactions between interconnected RE
                  cells were simulated with the use of a kinetic model of
                  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory synapses. 2. The
                  intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells in the model were
                  due to the presence of a low-threshold Ca2+ current and two
                  Ca(2+)-activated currents. The properties of these model RE
                  cells were compared with RE neurons recorded intracellularly
                  in vivo in cats. 3. Model RE cells densely interconnected with
                  GABAA synapses produced synchronous oscillations at a
                  frequency close to that of spindles (7\textendash{}14 Hz).
                  Networks of RE neurons organized in a two-dimensional array
                  with only proximal connectivity also exhibited synchronized
                  oscillations in the spindle range. In addition, the proximally
                  connected network showed periods of high and low
                  synchronicity, giving rise to waxing and waning oscillations
                  in the population of RE cells. 4. The spatiotemporal behavior
                  of the network was investigated during waxing and waning
                  oscillations. The waxing and waning emerged as an alternation
                  between periods of desynchronized and synchronized activity,
                  corresponding to periods of irregular and coherent spatial
                  activity. During synchronized periods, the network displayed
                  propagating coherent waves of synchronous activity that had a
                  tendency to form spirals. 5. Networks of model RE neurons
                  fully connected through GABAB synapses exhibited perfectly
                  synchronous oscillations at lower frequencies
                  (0.5\textendash{}1 Hz), but two-dimensional networks with
                  proximal GABAB connectivity failed to synchronize. 6. These
                  simulations demonstrate that networks of model neurons that
                  include the main intrinsic currents found in RE cells can
                  generate waxing and waning oscillatory activity similar to the
                  spindle rhythmicity observed in the isolated RE nucleus in
                  vivo. The model reveals the interplay between the intrinsic
                  rhythmic properties of RE cells and the fast synaptic
                  interactions in organizing synchronized rhythmicity.},

  abstract        = {We present ADINA, an automated pipeline for analyzing and
                  identifying neuronal activity from calcium imaging data to
                  investigate neuronal activity patterns. This entails the
                  detection and classification of cell centroids and of calcium
                  transients (events) that reappeared during different activity
                  periods as memory consolidation. Specifically, the pipeline
                  implements a sparse dictionary learning to infer the most
                  relevant Ca2+ patterns, an image segmentation procedure using
                  a wavelet- transform and watershed to identify single cells,
                  and an estimation of the transient signals by means of sparse
                  coding exploiting spatial and temporal sparsity. We validate
                  our automated approach on artificial and two different calcium
                  imaging sequences from mice hippocampal slice cultures
                  acquired with fluorescence and confocal microscopes. Our
                  approach achieves ca. 94\% sensitivity on average for
                  correctly detecting events, thus improving significantly the
                  estimation of cell signals relative to published procedures.},

  abstract        = {Joint interval scattergrams are usually employed in
                  determining serial correlations between events of spike
                  trains. However, any inherent structures in such scattergrams
                  that are often seen in experimental records are not
                  quantifiable by serial correlation coefficients. Here, we
                  develop a method to quantify clustered structures in any
                  two-dimensional scattergram of pairs of interspike intervals.
                  The method gives a cluster coefficient as well as clustering
                  density function that could be used to quantify clustering in
                  scattergrams obtained from first- or higher-order interval
                  return maps of single spike trains, or interspike interval
                  pairs drawn from simultaneously recorded spike trains. The
                  method is illustrated using numerical spike trains as well as
                  in~vitro pairwise recordings of rat striatal tonically active
                  neurons.},

                  Lecar 1981) admit very low frequency oscillations near the
                  critical applied current. Hansel et al. (1995) have
                  numerically shown that synchrony is difficult to achieve with
                  these models and that the phase resetting curve is strictly
                  positive. We use singular perturbation methods and averaging
                  to show that this is a general property of Type I membrane
                  models. We show in a limited sense that so called Type II
                  resetting occurs with models that obtain rhythmicity via a
                  Hopf bifurcation. We also show the differences between
                  synapses that act rapidly and those that act slowly and derive
                  a canonical form for the phase interactions.},

                  long-standing model for the mechanism by which circuits
                  generate rhythmic animal movement patterns. This review shows
                  that this model mechanism can explain the origins of cyclic
                  movements in six different preparations for which the neuronal
                  circuits are available. The overall function of reciprocal
                  inhibition, when combined with a variety of dynamic properties
                  in each of the circuits, is to generate stable antiphasic or
                  multiphasic output patterns. Apparent redundancy in the
                  identified circuits may lend additional robustness to the
                  oscillations, but it also increases the difficulty of
                  identifying critical circuit elements.}

  abstract        = {Holding a strong goal intention (“I intend to reach Z!”)
                  does not guarantee goal achievement, because people may fail
                  to deal effectively with self‐regulatory problems during goal
                  striving. This review analyzes whether realization of goal
                  intentions is facilitated by forming an implementation
                  intention that spells out the when, where, and how of goal
                  striving in advance (“If situation Y is encountered, then I
                  will initiate goal‐directed behavior X!”). Findings from 94
                  independent tests showed that implementation intentions had a
                  positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude (d = .65) on goal
                  attainment. Implementation intentions were effective in
                  promoting the initiation of goal striving, the shielding of
                  ongoing goal pursuit from unwanted influences, disengagement
                  from failing courses of action, and conservation of capability
                  for future goal striving. There was also strong support for
                  postulated component processes: Implementation intention
                  formation both enhanced the accessibility of specified
                  opportunities and automated respective goal‐directed
                  responses. Several directions for future research are
                  outlined.}

                  3380\textendash{}3382, 1998. In a slice preparation from adult
                  turtles, bath-applied N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) induced
                  rhythmic activity in spinal motoneurons. The underlying
                  intrinsic oscillation in membrane potential was revealed in
                  the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). NMDA-induced rhythmicity,
                  in the presence or absence of TTX, was abolished or reduced by
                  NMDA receptor antagonists and by three different classes of
                  antagonists for L-type calcium channels. It is suggested that
                  both NMDA receptor channels and L-type calcium channels

  abstract        = {In computational and pure mathematics it is necessary to
                  choose a representation or notation for the object being
                  computed or manipulated. The parallel between notation and
                  computational representation is quite close, although the
                  computer is able to deal with expressions that are far too
                  complicated to be dealt with by hand. A good notation makes
                  manipulations easier and reduces errors, and a good
                  computational representation makes operations easier to
                  implement, thus reducing coding errors. The choice of
                  representation is often not made explicitly, especially when
                  the objects are simple. The choice of representation also
                  serves to distinguish between algorithms. Indeed, once the
                  choice of a representation is made there are often fewer
                  choices of how to proceed. We use this approach in Sect. 3.2
                  to analyze five algorithms for higher-dimensional continuation
                  that are in the literature. For one-dimensional continuation
                  many issues are quite straightforward, since curves are easily
                  represented as lists of points. However, representing surfaces
                  and manifolds is more challenging. In Sect. 3.1.1 we discuss
                  simplicial and cell complexes, which are general meshes that
                  are commonly used in algebraic topology. Then we define
                  manifolds and manifolds with boundary, which are the analogues
                  of curves and arcs in one dimension. Section 3.1.2 describes
                  two fundamental geometric abstractions, the Voronoi and
                  Delaunay tessellations, and a particular generalization of the
                  Voronoi tessellation that represents the boundary of a union
                  of spherical balls. In Sect. 3.1.3 we discuss how these
                  topological and geometrical ideas have been used to represent
                  manifolds and, finally, how to construct the neighborhood of a
                  regular point.},

                  that paces the heartbeat of the leech. This model represents a
                  network of six heart interneurons that comprise the basic
                  rhythm-generating network within a single ganglion. This model
                  builds on a previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by
                  incorporating modifications of intrinsic and synaptic currents
                  based on the results of a realistic waveform voltage-clamp
                  study (Olsen and Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications,
                  the new model behaves more similarly to the biological system
                  than the previous model. For example, the slow-wave
                  oscillation of membrane potential that underlies bursting is
                  similar in form and amplitude to that of the biological
                  system. Furthermore, the new model with its expanded
                  architecture demonstrates how coordinating interneurons
                  contribute to the oscillations within a single ganglion, in
                  addition to their role of intersegmental coordination.},

                  existence of abnormal oscillations within the basal ganglia
                  with frequencies in the beta band (13-30 Hz). While the origin
                  of these oscillations remains unknown, there is some evidence
                  suggesting that oscillations observed in the basal ganglia
                  arise due to interactions of two nuclei: the subthalamic
                  nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). To
                  investigate this hypothesis, we develop a computational model
                  of the STN-GPe network based upon anatomical and
                  electrophysiological studies. Significantly, our study shows
                  that for certain parameter regimes, the model intrinsically
                  oscillates in the beta range. Through an analytical study of
                  the model, we identify a simple set of necessary conditions on
                  model parameters that guarantees the existence of beta
                  oscillations. These conditions for generation of oscillations
                  are described by a set of simple inequalities and can be
                  summarized as follows: (1) The excitatory connections from STN
                  to GPe and the inhibitory connections from GPe to STN need to
                  be sufficiently strong. (2) The time required by neurons to
                  react to their inputs needs to be short relative to synaptic
                  transmission delays. (3) The excitatory input from the cortex
                  to STN needs to be high relative to the inhibition from
                  striatum to GPe. We confirmed the validity of these conditions
                  via numerical simulation. These conditions describe changes in
                  parameters that are consistent with those expected as a result
                  of the development of Parkinson's disease, and predict
                  manipulations that could inhibit the pathological
                  oscillations.},

                  frequencies following brief synaptic excitation; activity
                  persists but rhythmbreaks down without electrical coupling;
                  NMDA voltage-dependency doubles the rangeof synaptic feedback

                  beswitched on and off at short latency by brief synaptic

                  excitatory feedback can generate sustained asynchronous

                  generate self-sustained activity following briefsynaptic
                  excitation. The frequency of activity is limited by the
                  kinetics of the neuronmembrane channels and can be stopped by
                  brief inhibitory input. Network activity canbe rhythmic at

                  mathematical modeling. We present a new and more detailed
                  computational model of lamprey locomotor network neurons,
                  based primarily on detailed electrophysiological measurements
                  and incorporating new experimental findings. The model uses a
                  Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley-like formalism and consists of 86
                  membrane compartments containing 12 types of ion currents. One
                  of the goals was to introduce a fast, transient potassium
                  current (Kt) and two sodium-dependent potassium currents, one
                  faster (KNaF) and one slower (KNaS), in the model. Not only

                  example, Kt was shown to be one critical factor for

                  oscillations when pharmacologically isolated from each other

                  oscillations have been characterized, for instance, in lamprey
                  locomotor network neurons. Conceptual and computational models
                  have been put forward to explain the appearance and

                  rhythms has sparked growing interest in the oscillatory
                  behaviours of neurons. Recent research has uncovered a close
                  association between electrical oscillations and resonance in
                  neurons. Resonance is an easily measurable property that
                  describes the ability of neurons to respond selectively to
                  inputs at preferred frequencies. A variety of ionic mechanisms
                  support resonance and oscillation in neurons. Understanding
                  the basic principles involved in the production of resonance
                  allows for a simplified classification of these mechanisms.
                  The characterization of resonance and frequency preference
                  captures those essential properties of neurons that can serve

                  varying stimuli and respond quickly to abrupt input changes
                  are crucial for basic neuronal computations, such as
                  coincidence detection, grouping by synchrony, and
                  spike-timing-dependent plasticity, as well as for the pro-
                  cessing speed of neuronal networks. Theoretical analyses have
                  linked these abilities to the fast-onset dynamics of action
                  potentials (APs). Using a combination of whole-cell recordings
                  from rat neocortical neurons and computer simulations, we
                  provide the first experimental evidence for this conjecture
                  and prove its validity for the case of distal AP initiation in
                  the axon initial segment (AIS), typical for cortical neurons.
                  Neocortical neurons with fast-onset APs in the soma can
                  phase-lock their population firing to signal frequencies up to
                  $\dottedsquare\dottedsquare$300 \textendash{} 400 Hz and
                  respond within 1\textendash{}2 ms to subtle changes of input
                  current. The ability to encode high frequencies and response
                  speed were dramatically reduced when AP onset was slowed by
                  experimental manipulations or was intrinsically slow due to
                  immature AP generation mechanisms. Multicompartment
                  conductance- based models reproducing the initiation of spikes
                  in the AIS could encode high frequencies only if AP onset was
                  fast at the initiation site (e.g., attributable to cooperative
                  gating of a fraction of sodium channels) but not when fast
                  onset of somatic AP was produced solely by backpropa- gation.
                  We conclude that fast-onset dynamics is a genuine property of
                  cortical AP generators. It enables fast computations in
                  cortical circuits that are rich in recurrent connections both
                  within each region and across the hierarchy of areas.},

                  was recorded for every 5 sec. 1. 1. The \texttheta{} activity
                  during mental performance seemed to originate in the frontal
                  midline area and tended to appear in the subtests that
                  required continous concentration of attention. 2. 2. As the

                  CPG-like motor networks is still not fully understood. The
                  main unsolved questions are (i) What are the respective roles
                  of intrinsic bursting and network based dynamics in systems of
                  coupled heterogeneous, intrinsically complex, even chaotic,
                  neurons? (ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the
                  coexistence of robustness and flexibility in the observed
                  rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns? One common view is that
                  particular bursting neurons provide the rhythmogenic component
                  while the connections between different neurons are
                  responsible for the regularisation and synchronisation of
                  groups of neurons and for specific phase relationships in
                  multi-phasic patterns. We have examined the spatio-temporal
                  rhythmic patterns in computer-simulated motif networks of
                  H\textendash{}H neurons connected by slow inhibitory synapses
                  with a non-symmetric pattern of coupling strengths. We
                  demonstrate that the interplay between intrinsic and network
                  dynamics features either cooperation or competition, depending
                  on three basic control parameters identified in our model: the
                  shape of intrinsic bursts, the strength of the coupling and
                  its degree of asymmetry. The cooperation of intrinsic dynamics
                  and network mechanisms is shown to correlate with bistability,
                  i.e., the coexistence of two different attractors in the phase
                  space of the system corresponding to different rhythmic
                  spatio-temporal patterns. Conversely, if the network mechanism
                  of rhythmogenesis dominates, monostability is observed with a
                  typical pattern of winnerless competition between neurons. We
                  analyse bifurcations between the two regimes and demonstrate
                  how they provide robustness and flexibility to the network

                  properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is
                  near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none
                  spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined
                  threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the
                  higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires.
                  In contrast, when the rest state is near an
                  Andronov\textendash{}Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a
                  certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it
                  does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire
                  in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a
                  resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain
                  (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input
                  frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing. We also
                  describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use
                  geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing
                  classification of bursters, including many new types. We
                  discuss how the type of burster defines its
                  neuro-computational properties, and we show that different

                  transition between a quiescent state and repetitive spiking.
                  When the transition to repetitive spiking occurs via a
                  subcritical Andronov--Hopf bifurcation and the transition to
                  the quiescent state occurs via fold limit cycle bifurcation,
                  the burster is said to be of elliptic type (also known as a
                  "subHopf/fold cycle" burster). Here we study the
                  synchronization dynamics of weakly connected networks of such
                  bursters. We find that the behavior of such networks is quite
                  different from the behavior of weakly connected phase
                  oscillators and resembles that of strongly connected
                  relaxation oscillators. As a result, such weakly connected
                  bursters need few (usually one) bursts to synchronize, and
                  synchronization is possible for bursters having quite
                  different quantitative features. We also find that
                  interactions between bursters depend crucially on the spiking
                  frequencies. Namely, the interactions are most effective when
                  the presynaptic interspike frequency matches the frequency of
                  postsynaptic oscillations. Finally, we use the

                  of spikes, as opposed to a single spike? A dominant point of
                  view is that bursts are needed to increase the reliability of
                  communication between neurons. Here, we discuss the
                  alternative, but complementary, hypothesis: bursts with
                  specific resonant interspike frequencies are more likely to
                  cause a postsynaptic cell to fire than are bursts with higher
                  or lower frequencies. Such a frequency preference might occur
                  at the level of individual synapses because of the interplay
                  between short-term synaptic depression and facilitation, or at
                  the postsynaptic cell level because of subthreshold membrane
                  potential oscillations and resonance. As a result, the same
                  burst could resonate for some synapses or cells and not
                  resonate for others, depending on their natural resonance
                  frequencies. This observation suggests that, in addition to
                  increasing reliability of synaptic transmission, bursts of
                  action potentials might provide effective mechanisms for
                  selective communication between neurons.},

                  general theory is formulated for the occurrence of such

                  spontaneous firings of Onchidium pacemaker neurons. In this
                  paper, we provide three cases of bifurcation processes related
                  to period-doubling bifurcation cascades to chaos observed in
                  the spontaneous firing patterns recorded from an injured site
                  of rat sciatic nerve as a pacemaker. Period-doubling
                  bifurcation cascades to period-4 ($\pi$(2,2)) firstly, and
                  then to chaos, at last to a periodicity, which can be
                  period-5, period-4 ($\pi$(4)) and period-3, respectively, in
                  different pacemakers. The three bifurcation processes are
                  labeled as case I, II and III, respectively, manifesting
                  procedures different to those of period-adding bifurcation.
                  Higher-dimensional unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) can be
                  detected in the chaos, built close relationships to the
                  periodic firing patterns. Case III bifurcation process is
                  similar to that discovered in the Onchidium pacemaker neurons
                  and simulated in theoretical model-Chay model. The extra-large
                  Feigenbaum constant manifesting in the period-doubling
                  bifurcation process, induced by quasi-discontinuous
                  characteristics exhibited in the first return maps of both ISI
                  series and slow variable of Chay model, shows that
                  higher-dimensional periodic behaviors appeared difficult
                  within the period-doubling bifurcation cascades. The results
                  not only provide examples of period-doubling bifurcation to
                  chaos and chaos with higher-dimensional UPOs, but also reveal
                  the dynamical features of the period-doubling bifurcation
                  cascades to chaos.},

                  functions such as a storage buffer and central executive
                  functions, but also coordination among these functions.
                  Neuroimaging studies have revealed the contributions of
                  different brain regions to different functional roles in WM
                  tasks; however, little is known about the neural mechanism
                  governing their coordination. Electroencephalographic (EEG)
                  rhythms, especially theta and alpha, are known to appear over
                  distributed brain regions during WM tasks, but the rhythms
                  associated with task-relevant regional coupling have not been
                  obtained thus far. In this study, we conducted
                  time\textendash{}frequency analyses for EEG data in WM tasks
                  that include manipulation periods and memory storage buffer
                  periods. We used both auditory WM tasks and visual WM tasks.
                  The results successfully demonstrated function-specific EEG
                  activities. The frontal theta amplitudes increased during the
                  manipulation periods of both tasks. The alpha amplitudes
                  increased during not only the manipulation but also the
                  maintenance periods in the temporal area for the auditory WM
                  and the parietal area for the visual WM. The phase
                  synchronization analyses indicated that, under the relevant
                  task conditions, the temporal and parietal regions show
                  enhanced phase synchronization in the theta bands with the
                  frontal region, whereas phase synchronization between theta
                  and alpha is significantly enhanced only within the individual
                  areas. Our results suggest that WM task-relevant brain regions
                  are coordinated by distant theta synchronization for central
                  executive functions, by local alpha synchronization for the
                  memory storage buffer, and by theta\textendash{}alpha coupling
                  for inter-functional integration.},

                  movement during morphogenesis and wound healing are of intense
                  interest and are only beginning to be understood. Here, we
                  investigate the forces responsible for morphogenesis during
                  dorsal closure with three approaches. First, we use real-time
                  and time-lapsed laser confocal microscopy to follow actin
                  dynamics and document cell shape changes and tissue movements
                  in living, unperturbed embryos. We label cells with a
                  ubiquitously expressed transgene that encodes GFP fused to an
                  autonomously folding actin binding fragment from fly moesin.
                  Second, we use a biomechanical approach to examine the
                  distribution of stiffness/tension during dorsal closure by
                  following the response of the various tissues to cutting by an
                  ultraviolet laser. We tested our previous model (Young, P.E.,
                  A.M. Richman, A.S. Ketchum, and D.P. Kiehart. 1993. Genes Dev.
                  7:29{\textendash}41) that the leading edge of the lateral
                  epidermis is a contractile purse-string that provides force
                  for dorsal closure. We show that this structure is under
                  tension and behaves as a supracellular purse-string, however,
                  we provide evidence that it alone cannot account for the
                  forces responsible for dorsal closure. In addition, we show
                  that there is isotropic stiffness/tension in the amnioserosa
                  and anisotropic stiffness/tension in the lateral epidermis.
                  Tension in the amnioserosa may contribute force for dorsal
                  closure, but tension in the lateral epidermis opposes it.
                  Third, we examine the role of various tissues in dorsal
                  closure by repeated ablation of cells in the amnioserosa and
                  the leading edge of the lateral epidermis. Our data provide
                  strong evidence that both tissues appear to contribute to
                  normal dorsal closure in living embryos, but surprisingly,
                  neither is absolutely required for dorsal closure. Finally, we
                  establish that the Drosophila epidermis rapidly and
                  reproducibly heals from both mechanical and ultraviolet laser
                  wounds, even those delivered repeatedly. During healing, actin
                  is rapidly recruited to the margins of the wound and a newly
                  formed, supracellular purse-string contracts during wound
                  healing. This result establishes the Drosophila embryo as an
                  excellent system for the investigation of wound healing.

                  depression and spike frequency adaptation. Physiologically
                  suggestive forms are used for both types of negative feedback.
                  We also consider the effects of employing two different types
                  of firing rate function, a Heaviside step function and a
                  piecewise linear function. We first derive conditions for the
                  existence of traveling fronts and pulses in the case of a
                  Heaviside step firing rate, and show that adaptation plays a
                  relatively minor role in determining the characteristics of
                  traveling waves. We then derive conditions for the existence
                  and stability of stationary pulses or bumps, and show that a

                  support stable bumps. However, bumps do not exist in the

                  Noise-induced population synchronization was previously
                  studied only for the case of global coupling, unlike the case
                  of subthreshold spiking neurons. Hence, we investigate the
                  effect of complex network architecture on noise-induced
                  synchronization in an inhibitory population of subthreshold
                  bursting Hindmarsh\textendash{}Rose neurons. For modeling
                  complex synaptic connectivity, we consider the
                  Watts\textendash{}Strogatz small-world network which
                  interpolates between regular lattice and random network via
                  rewiring, and investigate the effect of small-world
                  connectivity on emergence of noise-induced population
                  synchronization. Thus, noise-induced burst synchronization
                  (synchrony on the slow bursting time scale) and spike
                  synchronization (synchrony on the fast spike time scale) are
                  found to appear in a synchronized region of the
                  JJJ\textendash{}DDD plane (JJJ: synaptic inhibition strength
                  and DDD: noise intensity). As the rewiring probability ppp is
                  decreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the
                  region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the
                  JJJ\textendash{}DDD plane, while the region of the burst
                  synchronization decreases slowly. We separate the slow
                  bursting and the fast spiking time scales via frequency
                  filtering, and characterize the noise-induced burst and spike
                  synchronizations by employing realistic order parameters and
                  statistical-mechanical measures introduced in our recent work.
                  Thus, the bursting and spiking thresholds for the burst and
                  spike synchronization transitions are determined in terms of
                  the bursting and spiking order parameters, respectively.
                  Furthermore, we also measure the degrees of burst and spike
                  synchronizations in terms of the statistical-mechanical

                  Instantaneous population firing rate (IPFR) R(t)R(t)R(t),
                  which is directly obtained from the raster plot of neural
                  spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity
                  describing population activities in both the computational and
                  the experimental neuroscience. For the case of spiking
                  neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on
                  R(t)R(t)R(t), was introduced in our recent work to
                  characterize the spike synchronization transition. Unlike the
                  case of spiking neurons, the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) of bursting
                  neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow
                  bursting and the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we
                  decompose the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) into the instantaneous
                  population bursting rate Rb(t)Rb(t)R\_b(t) (describing the

                  Rs(t)Rs(t)R\_s(t) (describing the spiking behavior) via
                  frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order parameter
                  to the case of bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the
                  frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters which
                  are just the bursting and spiking ``coherence factors''
                  $\beta$b$\beta$b$\backslash$beta \_b and
                  $\beta$s$\beta$s$\backslash$beta \_s of the bursting and
                  spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of RbRbR\_b and
                  RsRsR\_s (i.e., ``signal to noise'' ratio of the spectral peak
                  height and its relative width). Through calculation of
                  $\beta$b$\beta$b$\backslash$beta \_b and
                  $\beta$s$\beta$s$\backslash$beta \_s, we obtain the bursting
                  and spiking thresholds beyond which the burst and spike
                  synchronizations break up, respectively. Consequently, it is
                  shown in explicit examples that the frequency-domain bursting

                  characterization of the bursting and the spiking transitions,

                  stimulation (tSOS; 0.75 Hz) was previously shown to enhance

                  applied during a sleep period characterized by emerging
                  endogenous slow oscillatory activity. Processes of memory
                  consolidation typically occurring during this state of sleep
                  were also enhanced. Here, we show that the same tSOS applied
                  in the waking brain also induced an increase in endogenous EEG
                  slow oscillations (0.4\textendash{}1.2 Hz), although in a
                  topographically restricted fashion. Applied during wakefulness
                  tSOS, additionally, resulted in a marked and widespread
                  increase in EEG theta (4\textendash{}8 Hz) activity. During
                  wake, tSOS did not enhance consolidation of memories when

                  hippocampus-dependent memories when applied during learning.
                  We conclude that the EEG frequency and related memory
                  processes induced by tSOS critically depend on brain state. In
                  response to tSOS during wakefulness the brain transposes

                  Here we pursue the question of whether this picture can be
                  justified and study the four-dimensional neuron model of
                  Hodgkin and Huxley as a concrete example. The model is
                  approximated by a response kernel expansion in terms of a
                  single variable, the membrane voltage. The first-order term is
                  linear in the input and its kernel has the typical form of an
                  elementary postsynaptic potential. Higher-order kernels take
                  care of nonlinear interactions between input spikes. In
                  contrast to the standard Volterra expansion, the kernels
                  depend on the firing time of the most recent output spike. In
                  particular, a zero-order kernel that describes the shape of
                  the spike and the typical after-potential is included. Our
                  model neuron fires if the membrane voltage, given by the
                  truncated response kernel expansion, crosses a threshold. The
                  threshold model is tested on a spike train generated by the
                  Hodgkin-Huxley model with a stochastic input current. We find
                  that the threshold model predicts 90 percent of the spikes
                  correctly. Our results show that, to good approximation, the

  abstract        = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo exhibit a wide range
                  of firing patterns. They normally fire constantly at a low
                  rate, and speed up, firing a phasic burst when reward exceeds
                  prediction, or pause when an expected reward does not occur.
                  Therefore, the detection of bursts and pauses from spike train
                  data is a critical problem when studying the role of phasic
                  dopamine (DA) in reward related learning, and other DA
                  dependent behaviors. However, few statistical methods have
                  been developed that can identify bursts and pauses
                  simultaneously. We propose a new statistical method, the
                  Robust Gaussian Surprise (RGS) method, which performs an
                  exhaustive search of bursts and pauses in spike trains
                  simultaneously. We found that the RGS method is adaptable to
                  various patterns of spike trains recorded in vivo, and is not
                  influenced by baseline firing rate, making it applicable to
                  all in vivo spike trains where baseline firing rates vary over
                  time. We compare the performance of the RGS method to other
                  methods of detecting bursts, such as the Poisson Surprise
                  (PS), Rank Surprise (RS), and Template methods. Analysis of
                  data using the RGS method reveals potential mechanisms

  abstract        = {Locomotor burst generation is simulated using a full-scale
                  network model of the unilateral excitatory interneuronal
                  population. Earlier small-scale models predicted that a
                  population of excitatory neurons would be sufficient to
                  produce burst activity, and this has recently been
                  experimentally confirmed. Here we simulate the hemicord
                  activity induced under various experimental conditions,
                  including pharmacological activation by NMDA and AMPA as well
                  as electrical stimulation. The model network comprises a
                  realistic number of cells and synaptic connectivity patterns.
                  Using similar distributions of cellular and synaptic
                  parameters, as have been estimated experimentally, a large
                  variation in dynamic characteristics like firing rates, burst,
                  and cycle durations were seen in single cells. On the network
                  level an overall rhythm was generated because the synaptic
                  interactions cause partial synchronization within the
                  population. This network rhythm not only emerged despite the
                  distributed cellular parameters but relied on this
                  variability, in particular, in reproducing variations of the
                  activity during the cycle and showing recruitment in
                  interneuronal populations. A slow rhythm (0.4\textendash{}2
                  Hz) can be induced by tonic activation of NMDA-sensitive
                  channels, which are voltage dependent and generate
                  depolarizing plateaus. The rhythm emerges through a
                  synchronization of bursts of the individual neurons. A fast
                  rhythm (4\textendash{}12 Hz), induced by AMPA, relies on spike
                  synchronization within the population, and each burst is
                  composed of single spikes produced by different neurons. The
                  dynamic range of the fast rhythm is limited by the ability of
                  the network to synchronize oscillations and depends on the
                  strength of synaptic connections and the duration of the slow
                  after hyperpolarization. The model network also produces
                  prolonged bouts of rhythmic activity in response to brief
                  electrical activations, as seen experimentally. The mutual
                  excitation can sustain long-lasting activity for a realistic
                  set of synaptic parameters. The bout duration depends on the
                  strength of excitatory synaptic connections, the level of
                  persistent depolarization, and the influx of Ca2+ ions and
                  activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current.},

                  on the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and
                  synchronization (ERS) of several narrow EEG frequency bands.
                  Methods: ERD/ERS responses of the 4\textendash{}6,
                  6\textendash{}8, 8\textendash{}10 and 10\textendash{}12 Hz EEG
                  frequency bands were studied in 24 normal subjects performing
                  a visual sequential letter task (so-called n-back task) in
                  which memory load was varied from 0 to 2. Results: In the
                  4\textendash{}6 Hz theta frequency band, a long-lasting
                  synchronization was observed in the anterior electrodes,
                  especially after the presentation of targets. In the
                  6\textendash{}8 and 8\textendash{}10 Hz frequency bands,
                  anterior ERS was elicited especially in the 2-back condition
                  (highest memory load). In contrast to the responses of the
                  8\textendash{}10 Hz frequency band, in the 10\textendash{}12
                  Hz frequency band the 2-back experimental condition elicited
                  the greatest ERD. Conclusions: In the highest memory load
                  (2-back) experimental condition the attentional capacities
                  were most probably exceeded, resulting in 6\textendash{}8 and
                  8\textendash{}10 Hz ERS. This might reflect an inhibition of
                  such brain areas (frontal cortices) no longer involved in task
                  completion when alternative strategies are needed and
                  utilized. These more `cognitive' strategies were then
                  reflected as an increase in 10\textendash{}12 Hz ERD.
                  Additionally, our results support the assumption that the
                  simultaneously recorded ERD/ERS responses of different narrow
                  EEG frequency bands differ and reflect distinct aspects of
                  information processing.},

                  boundary value problems (BVPs); see also Chaps. 1 and 2. In
                  conjunction with pseudo-arclength continuation, it is possible
                  to find the solution of a two-point BVP and then continue it
                  in parameters. This basic idea will be known to most readers
                  as the standard technique to compute a one-parameter branch of
                  periodic orbits. However, the continuation of BVPs is a much
                  more versatile tool and the solution need not be a periodic
                  orbit, but may be any specified orbit segment. For example,
                  the continuation of a suitable orbit segment is utilized in
                  the HomCont extension for the computation of connecting

                  many different methods have been proposed that typically

                  NR1-1a/2D heteromers also showed a similar degree of
                  inactivation. In contrast, NR1-1a/2B and NR1-1a/2C heteromers
                  showed no significant inactivation. At saturating
                  concentrations of NMDA (1 mM), NR1-1a/2A heteromers also
                  showed Ca- and glycine-independent desensitization, as seen in
                  native hippocampal neurons. Ca(2+)- and glycine-independent
                  desensitization was less pronounced in NR1-1a/2B heteromers
                  and absent in NR1-1a/2C heteromers. Activation of NR1-1a/2C
                  heteromers triggered intracellular Ca2+ transients similar to
                  NR1-1a/2A heteromers as verified by combined Ca2+ imaging and
                  whole-cell recording. Thus differences in Ca2+ permeability
                  were not responsible for the lack of inactivation in NR1-1a/2C
                  heteromers. Our results show that inactivation of recombinant
                  NMDA receptors requires either the NR2A or NR2D subunit,
                  whereas both inactivation and desensitization were absent in
                  NR2C-containing receptors. The gating of inactivating NMDA
                  receptors is more likely to be influenced by ongoing NMDA
                  receptor activity and Ca2+ transients, perhaps consistent with
                  the prominent expression of NR2A in hippocampus and cerebral
                  cortex.},

                  bath. A depolarization-activated inward current (DIC) has been
                  hypothesized to contribute to this bursting activity. To
                  explore the mechanism for STN burst firing in this setting, we
                  augmented a previously published conductance-based
                  computational model for single rat STN neurons to include both
                  DIC and NMDA currents, fit to data from published
                  electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show that with
                  these additions, the model engages in bursting activity at
                  $<$1 Hz in response to hyperpolarizing current injection and
                  that this bursting exhibits several features observed
                  experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model is used to
                  show that the combination of NMDA and DIC currents, but not
                  either alone, suffices to generate oscillations under
                  hyperpolarizing current injection. STN neurons show enhanced
                  burstiness in Parkinson's disease patients and experimental
                  models of parkinsonism, and the burst mechanism studied
                  presently could contribute to this effect.},

                  first edition of this book proved that the basic principles
                  used to select and present the material made sense. The idea
                  was to write a simple text that could serve as a seri ous
                  introduction to the subject. Of course, the meaning of
                  "simplicity" varies from person to person and from country to
                  country. The word "introduction" contains even more ambiguity.
                  To start reading this book, only a moder ate knowledge of
                  linear algebra and calculus is required. Other preliminaries,
                  qualified as "elementary" in modern mathematics, are
                  explicitly formulated in the book. These include the Fredholm
                  Alternative for linear systems and the multidimensional
                  Implicit Function Theorem. Using these very limited tools, a
                  framewo:k of notions, results, and methods is gradually built
                  that allows one to read (and possibly write) scientific papers
                  on bifurcations of nonlinear dynamical systems. Among other
                  things, progress in the sciences means that mathematical
                  results and methods that once were new become standard and
                  routinely used by the research and development community.
                  Hopefully, this edition of the book will contribute to this
                  process. The book's structure has been kept intact. Most of
                  the changes introduced reflect recent theoretical and software
                  developments in which the author was involved. Important
                  changes in the third edition can be summarized as follows. A
                  new section devoted to the fold-flip bifurcation for maps has

                  increases in automaticity (calculated with a sub‐set of SRHI

                  regressions fitted an asymptotic curve to each individual's

                  individuals, of whom 39 showed a good fit. Performing the

                  organized into external (ECL) and internal (ICL) cellular
                  layers separated by the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). The
                  most superficial layer, or vomeronasal nerve layer, is
                  composed of two fiber contingents that distribute in rostral
                  and caudal halves. The second layer, or glomerular layer, is
                  also divided by a conspicuous invagination of the neuropil of
                  the ECL at the junction of the rostral and caudal halves. The
                  ECL contains eight cell types distributed in three areas: a
                  subglomerular area containing juxtaglomerular and superficial
                  short-axon neurons, an intermediate area harboring large
                  principal cells (LPC), or mitral and tufted cells, and a deep
                  area containing dwarf, external granule, polygonal, and round
                  projecting cells. The ICL contains two neuron types: internal
                  granule (IGC) and main accessory cells (MACs). The dendrites
                  and axons of LPCs in the two AOB halves are organized
                  symmetrically with respect to an anatomical plane called linea
                  alba. The LPC axon collaterals may recruit adjacent intrinsic,
                  possibly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic, neurons that,
                  in turn, interact with the dendrites of the adjacent LPCs.
                  These modules may underlie the process of decoding pheromonal
                  clues. The most rostral ICL contains another neuron group
                  termed interstitial neurons of the bulbi (INBs) that includes
                  both intrinsic and projecting neurons. MACs and INBs share
                  inputs from fiber efferents arising in the main olfactory bulb
                  (MOB) and AOB and send axons to IGCs. Because IGCs are a
                  well-known source of modulatory inputs to LPCs, both MACs and
                  INBs represent a site of convergence of the MOB with the AOB.},

                  of about 5-15 bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min.
                  The rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging about 2
                  bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and about 4.5
                  bursts/min for neurons having 30 spikes/s. About 21\% of the
                  recorded units emitted significantly fewer bursts than the
                  rest (below 1 burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these
                  neurons was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during
                  bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average spike rate;
                  about the same for longer as for shorter bursts. Bursts
                  typically contained 10-50 spikes and lasted 0.5-2.0 s. When
                  the number of spikes in the successively emitted bursts was
                  listed, it was found that in some neurons these numbers were
                  not distributed at random but were clustered around one or
                  more preferred values. In this sense, bursts occasionally
                  "recurred" a few times in a few minutes. The finding suggests
                  that neurons are highly reliable. When bursts of two or more

                  often appeared to be temporally close, especially between
                  pairs of neurons recorded by the same electrode; but bursts
                  seldom started and ended simultaneously on two channels.

  abstract        = {The olfactory bulb differs from other brain regions by its
                  use of bidirectional synaptic transmission at dendrodendritic
                  reciprocal synapses. These reciprocal synapses provide tight
                  coupling of inhibitory feedback from granule cell interneurons
                  to mitral cell projection neurons in the accessory olfactory
                  bulb (AOB), at the first stage of vomeronasal processing. It
                  has been proposed that both the mGluR2 agonist DCG-IV and
                  noradrenaline promote mate recognition memory formation by
                  reducing GABAergic feedback on mitral cells. The resultant
                  mitral cell disinhibition is thought to induce a long-lasting
                  enhancement in the gain of inhibitory feedback from granule to
                  mitral cells, which selectively gates the transmission of the
                  learned chemosensory information. However, we found that local
                  infusions of both noradrenaline and DCG-IV failed to
                  disinhibit AOB neural activity in urethane-anaesthetised mice.
                  DCG-IV infusion had similar effects to the GABA(A) agonist
                  isoguvacine, suggesting that it increased GABAergic inhibition
                  in the AOB rather than reducing it. Noradrenaline infusion
                  into the AOB also failed to disinhibit mitral cells in awake
                  mice despite inducing long-term increases in power of AOB
                  local field potentials, similar to those observed following
                  memory formation. These results suggest that mitral cell
                  disinhibition is not essential for the neural changes in the
                  AOB that underlie mate recognition memory formation in mice.},

                  nigra pars compacta can be induced in vitro by the glutamate
                  agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate. It has been suggested that the
                  interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion by a
                  ouabain-sensitive pump [Johnson et al. (1992)Science258,
                  665\textendash{}667]. We formulate and explore a theoretical
                  model, with a minimal number of currents, for this novel
                  mechanism of burst generation. This minimal model is further
                  developed into a more elaborate model based on observations of
                  additional currents and hypotheses about their spatial
                  distribution in dopaminergic neurons [Hounsgaard
                  (1992)Neuroscience50, 513\textendash{}518; Llin{\'a}s et al.
                  (1984)Brain Res.294, 127\textendash{}132]. Using the minimal
                  model, we confirm that interaction between the regenerative,
                  inward N-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated current and the outward
                  Na+-pump current is sufficient to generate the slow
                  oscillation ($\sim$0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The
                  negative-slope region of the N-methyl-d-aspartate channel's
                  current-voltage relation is indispensable for this slow rhythm
                  generation. The time-scale of Na+-handling determines the
                  burst's slow frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the
                  constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is best
                  explained mechanistically by using at least two spatial,
                  cable-like compartments: a soma where action potentials are
                  produced and a dendritic compartment where the slow rhythm is
                  generated. Our result is consistent with recent experimental
                  evidence that burst generation originates in distal dendrites
                  [Seutin et al. (1994)Neuroscience58, 201\textendash{}206].
                  Responses of the model to a number of electrophysiological and
                  pharmacological stimuli are consistent with known responses
                  observed under similar conditions. These include the
                  persistence of the slow rhythm when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive
                  Na+ channel is blocked and when the soma is voltage-clamped at
                  -60 mV. Using our more elaborate model, we account for details
                  of the observed frequency adaptation in
                  N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of multiple
                  spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the interaction between
                  two different bursting mechanisms. Besides reproducing several
                  well established firing patterns, this model also suggests
                  that new firing modes, not yet recorded, might also occur in
                  dopaminergic neurons. This model provides mechanistic insights
                  and explanations into the origin of a variety of
                  experimentally observed membrane potential firing patterns in
                  dopaminergic neurons, including N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced
                  bursting and its dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of
                  reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of dopaminergic
                  neurons, could be useful in further studies of the basal
                  ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. It may also shed light
                  on bursting that involves N-methyl-d-aspartate channel
                  activity in other neuron types.},

                  analysis of insect outbreak systems using spruce budworm and
                  balsam fir as an example. This consists of separating the
                  state variables into fast and slow categories. (2) The
                  dynamics of the fast variables are analysed first, holding the
                  slow variables fixed. Then the dynamics of the slow variables
                  are analysed, with the fast variables held at corresponding
                  equilibrium values. If there are several such equilibria,
                  there are several possibilities for the slow dynamics. (3) In
                  the case of the budworm, this analysis exhibits the
                  possibility of `relaxation oscillations' which are familiar
                  from theory of the Van der Pol oscillator. In more modern
                  terminology, the jumps of the system are governed by a cusp
                  catastrophe. (4) Such an analysis can be made on the basis of
                  qualitative information only, but additional insight emerges
                  when parameter ranges are defined by the kind of information
                  typically available from an experienced biologist. (5) At the
                  least this can be a guide to assess subsequent priorities for
                  both research and policy.},

                  occurrence (``spike trains'') from cellular fluorescence
                  signals. It remains unclear how experimental parameters such
                  as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition rate affect
                  spike inference and whether additional information about
                  network structure can be extracted. Here we present a
                  simulation framework for quantitatively assessing how well
                  spike dynamics and network topology can be inferred from noisy
                  calcium imaging data. For simulated AP-evoked calcium
                  transients in neocortical pyramidal cells, we analyzed the
                  quality of spike inference as a function of SNR and data
                  acquisition rate using a recently introduced peeling
                  algorithm. Given experimentally attainable values of SNR and
                  acquisition rate, neural spike trains could be reconstructed
                  accurately and with up to millisecond precision. We then
                  applied statistical neuronal network models to explore how
                  remaining uncertainties in spike inference affect estimates of
                  network connectivity and topological features of network
                  organization. We define the experimental conditions suitable
                  for inferring whether the network has a scale-free structure
                  and determine how well hub neurons can be identified. Our
                  findings provide a benchmark for future calcium imaging

  abstract        = {Whether drugs that enhance cognition in healthy individuals
                  will appear in the near future has become a topic of
                  considerable interest. We address this possibility using a
                  three variable system (psychological effect, neurobiological
                  mechanism, efficiency vs. capabilities) for classifying
                  candidates. Ritalin and modafinil, two currently available
                  compounds, operate on primary psychological states that in
                  turn affect cognitive operations (attention, memory), but
                  there is little evidence that these effects translate into
                  improvements in complex cognitive processing. A second
                  category of potential enhancers includes agents that improve
                  memory encoding, generally without large changes in primary
                  psychological states. Unfortunately, there is little
                  information on how these compounds affect cognitive
                  performance in standard psychological tests. Recent
                  experiments have identified a number of sites at which memory
                  drugs could, in principle, manipulate the cell biological
                  systems underlying the learning-related long-term potentiation
                  (LTP) effect; this may explain the remarkable diversity of
                  memory promoting compounds. Indeed, many of these agents are
                  known to have positive effects on LTP. A possible third
                  category of enhancement drugs directed specifically at
                  integrated cognitive operations is nearly empty. From a
                  neurobiological perspective, two plausible candidate classes
                  have emerged that both target the fast excitatory transmission
                  responsible for communication within cortical networks. One
                  acts on nicotinic receptors (alpha7, alpha4) that regulate
                  release of the neurotransmitter glutamate while the other
                  (`ampakines') allosterically modulates the glutamate receptors
                  mediating the post-synaptic response (EPSCs). Brain imaging in
                  primates has shown that ampakines expand cortical networks
                  engaged by a complex task; coupled with behavioral data, these
                  findings provide evidence for the possibility of generating
                  new cognitive capabilities. Finally, we suggest that
                  continuing advances in behavioral sciences provide new
                  opportunities for translational work, and that discussions of
                  the social impact of cognitive enhancers have failed to
                  consider the distinction between effects on efficiency vs. new
                  capabilities.},

  abstract        = {In the course of animal morphogenesis, large-scale cell
                  movements occur, which involve the rearrangement, mutual
                  spreading, and compartmentalization of cell populations in
                  specific configurations. Morphogenetic cell rearrangements
                  such as cell sorting and mutual tissue spreading have been
                  compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which they
                  closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been
                  proposed that tissues behave as liquids and possess a
                  characteristic surface tension, which arises as a collective,
                  macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering cells. But
                  how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories
                  have been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties
                  such as cell{\textendash}cell adhesion and contractility of
                  cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface tensions. Although
                  recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an
                  explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on
                  these mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show
                  explicitly that the ratio of adhesion to cortical tension
                  determines tissue surface tension. Our minimal model
                  successfully explains the available experimental data and
                  makes predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical
                  energy and geometry, about the shapes of aggregate surface
                  cells, which we verify experimentally. This model indicates
                  that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to
                  cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio
                  between these two quantities.},

                  activity regimes can coexist with each other in a given neuron
                  so that a transient stimulus can cause a persistent change of
                  activity. Such multistability of the neuronal dynamics has in
                  fact been shown in a variety of neurons and can play either a
                  functional role or present a substrate for neurological
                  diseases. We explored the propensity for multistability in a
                  database of a leech heart interneuron model, testing each case
                  (parameter set) in a database for multistability. We found a
                  large proportion of multistable cases, especially the
                  coexistence of silent and bursting regimes. This was a
                  surprising result, since these cells pace the heartbeat of the
                  leech, and the coexistence of silence and bursting could
                  disrupt the functional pattern, threatening the viability of
                  the leech. Analysis of networks of mutually inhibitory
                  multistable neurons, however, showed robustness in maintaining
                  functional activity, suggesting that the mutually inhibitory
                  coupling can act as a protective mechanism against failures
                  induced by multistability.},

                  is critical for understanding normal and pathological brain
                  processes. Here we used electrophysiology in mouse neocortical
                  slices and principles of nonlinear dynamics to demonstrate how
                  an increase in the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)
                  conductance can create a nonlinear whole-cell current-voltage
                  ( I \textendash{} V ) relationship, which leads to changes in
                  cellular stability. We discovered two behaviorally and
                  morphologically distinct pyramidal cell populations. Under
                  control conditions, both cell types responded to depolarizing
                  current injection with regular spiking patterns. However, upon
                  NMDAR activation, an intrinsic oscillatory (IO) cell type (n =
                  44) showed a nonlinear whole-cell I \textendash{} V
                  relationship, intrinsic voltage-dependent oscillations plus
                  amplification of alternating input current, and these
                  properties persisted after disabling action potential
                  generation with TTX. The other non-oscillatory (NO) neuronal
                  population (n = 24) demonstrated none of these behaviors.,
                  Simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings demonstrated
                  the NMDAR's capacity to promote low-frequency seizure-like
                  network oscillations via its effects on intrinsic neuronal
                  properties. The two pyramidal cell types demonstrated
                  different relationships with network oscillation: the IO cells
                  were leaders that were activated early in the population
                  activity cycle while the activation of the NO cell type was
                  distributed across network bursts. The properties of IO
                  neurons disappeared in a low magnesium environment where the
                  voltage-dependence of the receptor is abolished; concurrently,
                  the cellular contribution to network oscillation switched to
                  synchronous firing. Thus, depending upon the efficacy of NMDAR
                  in altering the linearity of the whole-cell current-voltage
                  relationship, the two cell populations played different roles
                  in sustaining network oscillation.},

                  identified population of ventromedial interneurons, called
                  Hb9, in the mouse spinal cord has been shown to generate
                  TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations in the presence
                  of NMDA, serotonin and dopamine, but these oscillatory
                  properties are not well characterized. Hb9 interneurons are
                  rhythmically active during fictive locomotor-like behavior. In
                  this study, we report that exogenous N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid
                  (NMDA) application is sufficient to produce membrane potential
                  oscillations in Hb9 interneurons. In contrast, exogenous
                  serotonin and dopamine application, alone or in combination,
                  are not sufficient. The properties of NMDA-induced
                  oscillations vary among the Hb9 interneuron population; their
                  frequency and amplitude increase with increasing NMDA
                  concentration. NMDA does not modulate the T-type calcium
                  current (ICa(T)), which is thought to be important in
                  generating locomotor-like activity, in Hb9 neurons. These
                  results suggest that NMDA receptor activation is sufficient

                  displayed by central pattern generators and other neural
                  circuits. Understanding this complex activity requires the
                  knowledge of the interplay between the intrinsic cell
                  properties and the properties of synaptic coupling between the
                  cells. Here we describe a simple method that allows us to
                  investigate the existence and stability of anti-phase bursting
                  solutions in a network of two spiking neurons, each possessing
                  a T-type calcium current and coupled by reciprocal inhibition.
                  We derive a one-dimensional map which fully characterizes the
                  genesis and regulation of anti-phase bursting arising from the
                  interaction of the T-current properties with the properties of
                  synaptic inhibition. This map is the burst length return map

                  properties of a single isolated model neuron, the composition
                  of the two maps accurately captures the behavior of the full
                  network. We analyze the parameter sensitivity of these maps to
                  determine the influence of both the intrinsic cell properties
                  and the synaptic properties on the burst length, and to find
                  the conditions under which multistability of several bursting
                  solutions is achieved. Although the derivation of the map
                  relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, we discuss how
                  the principle features of this dimensional reduction method
                  could be extended to more realistic model networks.},

  year            = 2014,
  abstract        = {In this thesis we model two very different movement-related
                  neuronal circuits, both of which produce oscillatory patterns
                  of activity. In one case we study oscillatory activity in the
                  basal ganglia under both normal and Parkinsonian conditions.
                  First, we used a detailed Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking model to
                  investigate the activity patterns that arise when oscillatory
                  cortical input is transmitted to the globus pallidus via the
                  subthalamic nucleus. Our model reproduced a result from rodent
                  studies which shows that two anti-phase oscillatory groups of
                  pallidal neurons appear under Parkinsonian conditions.
                  Secondly, we used a population model of the basal ganglia to
                  study whether oscillations could be locally generated. The
                  basal ganglia are thought to be organised into multiple
                  parallel channels. In our model, isolated channels could not
                  generate oscillations, but if the lateral inhibition between
                  channels is sufficiently strong then the network can act as a
                  rhythm-generating ``pacemaker'' circuit. This was particularly
                  true when we used a set of connection strength parameters that
                  represent the basal ganglia under Parkinsonian conditions.
                  Since many things are not known about the anatomy and
                  electrophysiology of the basal ganglia, we also studied
                  oscillatory activity in another, much simpler,
                  movement-related neuronal system: the spinal cord of the
                  Xenopus tadpole. We built a computational model of the spinal
                  cord containing approximately 1,500 biologically realistic
                  Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, with synaptic connectivity derived
                  from a computational model of axon growth. The model produced
                  physiological swimming behaviour and was used to investigate
                  which aspects of axon growth and neuron dynamics are
                  behaviourally important. We found that the oscillatory
                  attractor associated with swimming was remarkably stable,
                  which suggests that, surprisingly, many features of axonal
                  growth and synapse formation are not necessary for swimming to
                  emerge. We also studied how the same spinal cord network can
                  generate a different oscillatory pattern in which neurons on
                  both sides of the body fire synchronously. Our results here
                  suggest that under normal conditions the synchronous state is
                  unstable or weakly stable, but that even small increases in
                  spike transmission delays act to stabilise it. Finally, we
                  found that although the basal ganglia and the tadpole spinal
                  cord are very different systems, the underlying mechanism by
                  which they can produce oscillations may be remarkably similar.
                  Insights from the tadpole model allow us to predict how the
                  basal ganglia model may be capable of producing multiple
                  patterns of oscillatory activity.},

                  between the size of the network that can be simulated and the
                  complexity of the model used for individual neurons. In this
                  study, we describe a generalization of the leaky
                  integrate-and-fire model that produces a wide variety of
                  spiking behaviors while still being analytically solvable
                  between firings. For different parameter values, the model
                  produces spiking or bursting, tonic, phasic or adapting
                  responses, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing after potentials
                  and so forth. The model consists of a diagonalizable set of
                  linear differential equations describing the time evolution of
                  membrane potential, a variable threshold, and an arbitrary
                  number of firing-induced currents. Each of these variables is
                  modified by an update rule when the potential reaches
                  threshold. The variables used are intuitive and have
                  biological significance. The model's rich behavior does not
                  come from the differential equations, which are linear, but
                  rather from complex update rules. This single-neuron model can
                  be implemented using algorithms similar to the standard
                  integrate-and-fire model. It is a natural match with
                  event-driven algorithms for which the firing times are
                  obtained as a solution of a polynomial equation.},

                  of the key factors involved in various brain computations.
                  Central executive function typically requires instantaneous
                  coordination among the medial prefrontal regions and other
                  distant regions, depending on the on-going task situation. In
                  human scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), the medial
                  prefrontal area is estimated to be the current source of the
                  theta rhythm, while there is no direct evidence that the theta
                  rhythm is involved in the dynamic networking of central
                  executive circuits. Here we hypothesize that the central
                  executive circuit over the prefrontal and task-related
                  cortices is dynamically linked by theta synchronization. By
                  using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging
                  (fMRI) and EEG, we elucidated cortical circuits emerging with
                  theta phase synchronization during free pacing repeated
                  subtraction. Theta phase synchronization in the scalp EEG was
                  found to emerge at two major clusters of electrode pairs,
                  between the right frontal and left parietal sites and between
                  the frontal and right parietal sites. The phase
                  synchronization of two clusters is accompanied by fMRI
                  responses in the cortical regions responsible for central
                  executive function, working memory, visual imagery and
                  cognitive action sequence. Here we report the first evidence
                  that theta phase synchronization dynamically coordinates the
                  central executive circuits, including the medial prefrontal
                  cortex and relevant cortical regions.},

                  nonlinearity is mainly controlled by the spiking rates, the

                  kinetic data of the voltage dependent ionic channels located
                  both on the soma and on highly branched dendritic membranes.
                  Pressure pulses of NMDA applied to the most peripheral regions
                  of the dendritic tree elicited large somatic impedance
                  increases, indicating that the most peripheral dendrites are

                  stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior
                  when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA.
                  Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the
                  external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked.
                  Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active
                  conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the
                  complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems
                  paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible
                  modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating
                  conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to
                  the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The
                  differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the
                  fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical
                  techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the
                  system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained
                  oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b)
                  considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory
                  potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to
                  changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time
                  during cellular activity), a system dominated by two
                  noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory

                  assigning optically recorded signals to individual cells have
                  not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated sorting
                  procedure that combines independent component analysis and

                  membrane potentials. A neuronal cable model was used to
                  explicitly take into account receptors located on the
                  dendritic trees. The driving point membrane admittance was
                  measured from the cell soma in response to a Fourier
                  synthesized point voltage clamp stimulus. The data were fitted
                  to an equivalent cable model consisting of a single lumped
                  soma compartment coupled resistively to a series of equal
                  dendritic compartments. The model contains voltage-dependent
                  NMDA sensitive (INMDA), slow potassium (IK), and leakage (IL)
                  currents. Both the passive cable properties and the voltage

                  voltage- and time-dependent ionic conductances. An alternate
                  kinetic formulation was developed that consisted of
                  steady-state values for the gating parameters and their time
                  constants at half-activation values as well as slopes of these
                  parameters at half-activation. This procedure allowed
                  independent restrictions on the magnitude and slope of both
                  the steady-state gating variable and its associated time
                  constant. Quantitative estimates of the voltage-dependent
                  membrane ion conductances and their kinetic parameters were
                  used to solve the nonlinear equations describing dynamic
                  responses. The model accurately predicts current clamp
                  responses and is consistent with experimentally measured
                  TTX-resistant NMDA-induced patterned activity. In summary, an
                  analysis method is developed that provides a pragmatic
                  approach to quantitatively describe a nonlinear neuronal

                  exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional
                  significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is
                  not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory
                  network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic
                  depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network
                  operation. When the maximal conductance of the depressing
                  synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the
                  oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance
                  beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback
                  mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this
                  mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and
                  dynamics of the depressing synapse. Because of the
                  regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can
                  be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very
                  small change in the maximal conductance of the depressing
                  synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the
                  pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a
                  simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that
                  receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In
                  some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on
                  the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there
                  was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the
                  pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes
                  suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance
                  of the depressing synapse.},

                  evolution equation that describes the nerve propagation in
                  biology. It is often useful to obtain a generalized solitary

                  solution in the space of initial conditions (or even in the
                  space of the system's parameters) can not be derived by the
                  Exp-function method because the question about the existence
                  of that solution is omitted. The proposed operator method, on
                  the contrary, brings the load of symbolic computations before

                  models has been used to faithfully model spiking neurons. This
                  class includes the Izhikevich model, the adaptive exponential
                  integrate and fire model, and the quartic integrate and fire
                  model. The bifurcation types for the individual neurons have
                  been thoroughly analyzed by Touboul (SIAM J Appl Math
                  68(4):1045\textendash{}1079, 2008). However, when the models
                  are coupled together to form networks, the networks can
                  display bifurcations that an uncoupled oscillator cannot. For
                  example, the networks can transition from firing with a
                  constant rate to burst firing. This paper introduces a
                  technique to reduce a full network of this class of neurons to
                  a mean field model, in the form of a system of switching
                  ordinary differential equations. The reduction uses population
                  density methods and a quasi-steady state approximation to
                  arrive at the mean field system. Reduced models are derived
                  for networks with different topologies and different model
                  neurons with biologically derived parameters. The mean field
                  equations are able to qualitatively and quantitatively
                  describe the bifurcations that the full networks display.

                  leeches constitutes seven identified pairs of segmental heart
                  interneurons. Four identified pairs of heart interneurons make
                  a staggered pattern of inhibitory synaptic connections with
                  segmental heart motor neurons. Using extracellular recording
                  from multiple interneurons in the network in 56 isolated nerve
                  cords, we show that this pattern generator produces a
                  side-to-side asymmetric pattern of intersegmental coordination
                  among ipsilateral premotor interneurons. This pattern
                  corresponds to a similarly asymmetric fictive motor pattern in
                  heart motor neurons and asymmetric constriction pattern of the
                  two tubular hearts, synchronous and peristaltic. We provide a
                  quantitative description of the firing pattern of all the
                  premotor interneurons, including phase, duty cycle, and
                  intraburst frequency of this premotor activity pattern. This
                  analysis identifies two stereotypical coordination modes
                  corresponding to synchronous and peristaltic, which show phase
                  constancy over a broad range of periods as do the fictive
                  motor pattern and the heart constriction pattern. Coordination
                  mode is controlled through one segmental pair of heart
                  interneurons (switch interneurons). Side-to-side switches in
                  coordination mode are a regular feature of this pattern
                  generator and occur with changes in activity state of these
                  switch interneurons. Associated with synchronous coordination
                  of premotor interneurons, the ipsilateral switch interneuron
                  is in an active state, during which it produces rhythmic
                  bursts, whereas associated with peristaltic coordination, the
                  ipsilateral switch interneuron is largely silent. We argue
                  that timing and pattern elaboration are separate functions
                  produced by overlapping subnetworks in the heartbeat central
                  pattern generator.},

                  which the map has no derivative (it has two one-sided
                  derivatives). The point c is the border of two intervals in
                  which the map is smooth. As the parameter $\mu$ is varied, a
                  fixed point (or periodic point) E$\mu$ may cross the point c,
                  and we may assume that this crossing occurs at $\mu$=0. The
                  investigation of what bifurcations occur at $\mu$=0 reduces to
                  a study of a map f$\mu$ depending linearly on $\mu$ and two
                  other parameters a and b. A variety of bifurcations occur
                  frequently in such situations. In particular, E$\mu$ may cross
                  the point c, and for $\mu$$<$0 there can be a fixed point
                  attractor, and for $\mu>$0 there may be a period-3 attractor

                  bifurcations from a fixed point attractor to a period-m
                  attractor, a 2m-piece chaotic attractor, an m-piece chaotic
                  attractor, or a one-piece chaotic attractor can occur for
                  piecewise smooth one-dimensional maps. These bifurcations are
                  called border-collision bifurcations. For almost every point

                  explicitly which border-collision bifurcation actually does
                  occur. We believe this phenomenon will be seen in many

                  of MCs to develop a passive compartmental model based on

                  Matching the model to traces recorded in experiments we find:

                  MC gap-junction (GJ) network model of morphologically accurate
                  MCs. These passive parameters (PPs) were then incorporated

                  from Migliore et al. (2005). The GJs were placed in the apical

                  coupling ratio between MCs consistent with experimental
                  findings ( 0.04). Firing at 50 Hz was induced in all six MCs
                  with continuous current injections (0.05-0.07 nA) at 20
                  locations to the ADT of two of the MCs. It was found that MCs
                  in the network synchronized better when they shared identical
                  PPs rather than using their own PPs for the fit suggesting

                  and L-type calcium channels (iCa(L)) (Bhalla and Bower, 1993)
                  to the model enabled MCs to generate burst firing. However,
                  the GJ coupling was no longer sufficient to synchronize
                  firing. When cells were stimulated by a continuous current
                  injection there was an initial period of asynchronous burst
                  firing followed after 120 ms by synchronous repetitive firing.
                  This occurred as intracellular calcium fell due to reduced
                  iCa(L) activity. The kinetics of one of the iCa(L) gate
                  variables, which had a long activation time constant ($\tau$
                  range 18-150 ms), was responsible for this fall in iCa(L). The
                  model makes predictions about the nature of the kinetics of
                  the calcium current that will need experimental verification.},

  abstract        = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons send numerous projections to
                  cortical and sub-cortical areas, and in a manner dependent
                  upon their activities, diffusely release dopamine (DA) to
                  their targets. Recent experimental studies have shown that
                  DAergic neuronal bursting is associated with a significantly
                  greater degree of DA release than an equivalent tonic activity
                  pattern. Past computational models for DA cell activity relied
                  upon somatodendritic mechanisms in order to generate DA
                  neuronal bursting. However, recent experimental studies
                  indicate that burst firing can be generated somatically with
                  the dendrites silenced. These somatically induced bursts have
                  characteristics consistent with normal bursting, suggesting
                  that a single-compartmental model should be sufficient for
                  generating the observed DA neuronal dynamics. In this work, we
                  introduce such a model for DA neuronal dynamics and
                  demonstrate that this model captures the qualitative behavior
                  of DAergic neuronal dynamics: quiescence, tonic firing and
                  bursting. In our conductance-based approach, the interplay
                  between the L-type calcium and the calcium dependent SK
                  potassium channel provides a scaffold for the underlying
                  oscillation for the pacemaker-like firing patterns. The model
                  includes terms which can selectively block the SK conductance,
                  which would correspond to pharmacological manipulations using
                  the drug apamin. Our modeling studies are in line with
                  experimental evidence that a reduction of the SK conductance
                  often induces DA neuronal bursting. Moreover, our model can
                  reproduce findings that burst firing can be elicited via
                  stimulus driven events, manifested by rises in the amount of
                  NMDA. This model for DA cell activity could be further
                  sculpted to include more detailed second messenger signaling
                  processes in order to elucidate key differences between the
                  two principal classes of midbrain DA neurons: those of the
                  ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra pars
                  compacta.},

                  regions involved in working memory (WM) retrieval. Neural
                  activation was examined in two WM tasks: an item recognition
                  task, which can be mediated by a direct-access retrieval
                  process, and a judgment of recency task that requires a serial
                  search. Dissociations were found in the activation patterns in
                  the hippocampus and in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)
                  when the probe contained the most recently studied serial
                  position (where a test probe can be matched to the contents of
                  focal attention) compared to when it contained all other
                  positions (where retrieval is required). The data implicate
                  the hippocampus and the LIFG in retrieval from WM,
                  complementing their established role in long-term memory.
                  Results further suggest that the left posterior parietal
                  cortex (LPPC) supports serial retrieval processes that are
                  often required to recover temporal order information.
                  Together, these data suggest that the LPPC, the LIFG, and the
                  hippocampus collectively support WM retrieval. Critically, the
                  reported findings support accounts that posit a distinction
                  between representations maintained in and outside of focal
                  attention, but are at odds with traditional dual-store models
                  that assume distinct mechanisms for short- and long-term

                  in a living tissue, a wide variety of close-packed collective
                  systems—both inert and living—have the potential to jam. The
                  collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify
                  like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly
                  understood, however, and structural properties characterizing
                  these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial
                  epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in
                  asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that
                  system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly,
                  the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive
                  relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell–cell
                  adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental
                  observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural
                  signature for classification and investigation of bronchial
                  epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any
                  process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics

                  functions have been shown to emerge by theta ($\sim$6~Hz)
                  phase-coupling of distant cortical areas [1,2,3]. It has been
                  repeatedly shown that frontoparietal theta coupling at
                  $\sim$0$^\circ$ relative phase is associated with recognition,
                  encoding, short-term retention, and planning [1,4,5]; however,
                  a causal link has not been demonstrated so far. Here we used
                  transcranial alternating current stimulation [6,7,8]
                  simultaneously applied at 6~Hz over left prefrontal and
                  parietal cortices with a relative 0$^\circ$ (``synchronized''
                  condition) or 180$^\circ$ (``desynchronized'' condition) phase
                  difference or a placebo stimulation condition, whereas healthy
                  subjects performed a delayed letter discrimination task. We
                  show that exogenously induced frontoparietal theta
                  synchronization significantly improves visual memory-matching
                  reaction times as compared to placebo stimulation. In
                  contrast, exogenously induced frontoparietal theta
                  desynchronization deteriorates performance. The present
                  findings provide for the first time evidence of causality of
                  theta phase-coupling of distant cortical areas for cognitive
                  performance in healthy humans. Moreover, the results
                  demonstrate the suitability of transcranial alternating
                  current stimulation to artificially induce coupling or
                  decoupling of behaviorally relevant brain rhythms between
                  segregated cortical regions.},

  abstract        = {The pre-Botzinger complex (pBC) is a vital subcircuit of
                  the respiratory central pattern generator. Although the
                  existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties
                  in this network is not questioned, their role in network
                  rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to
                  address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical
                  parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be
                  manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of
                  experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker
                  neurons using a modified version of our previously developed
                  pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of
                  pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated
                  networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the
                  population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker
                  neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network
                  and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting
                  produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling
                  and sparsely connected networks were explored for several
                  levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only
                  nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but
                  with a low probability of bursting and low input and output
                  ranges. Our results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in
                  an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by
                  more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with
                  networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in
                  dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the
                  network is greater than 20\% of the population. Experimental
                  tests of our model predictions are proposed.},

  abstract        = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions
                  has a history of success over the last half century. This
                  includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some
                  features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting
                  dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological
                  experiments have been suggested over the last two decades.
                  Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually
                  these models and results are based on traditional approaches
                  and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos.
                  Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear
                  dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural
                  network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has
                  an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These
                  make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to
                  their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional
                  physical systems described by well-known basic principles,
                  first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are
                  unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar
                  dynamics despite having different architectures and different
                  levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and
                  connection strengths are usually not known in detail and
                  therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be
                  probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize
                  behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of
                  these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal
                  information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal
                  codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this
                  review these problems are discussed in the context of
                  addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience
                  learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics
                  learn from neuroscience?},

                  interaction between synaptic and membrane properties of
                  functionally defined neurons. To gain a better understanding
                  of how inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs lead to the
                  generation of the respiratory rhythm we analyzed the
                  depolarization pattern of respiratory neurons that were
                  recorded in the transverse slice preparation of mice
                  (P8\textendash{}22) and the in vivo adult cat. Using
                  voltage-clamp recordings from respiratory neurons and specific
                  antagonists for inhibitory synaptic transmission we
                  demonstrate under in vitro conditions, that inspiratory (n=7)
                  and post-inspiratory neurons (n=13) received concurrent
                  glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic input during
                  inspiration. A similar conclusion was gained with chloride
                  injections into in vivo respiratory neurons. The inhibitory
                  input was essential not only for generating the characteristic
                  depolarization pattern of respiratory neurons, but also for
                  switching the respiratory rhythm between inspiration and
                  post-inspiration. The generation of the depolarization pattern
                  depends also on intrinsic membrane properties. Negative
                  current injections reveal that excitatory synaptic input was
                  amplified by intrinsic bursting properties in some inspiratory
                  neurons (n=4) recorded in vitro. Although such properties have
                  not been described under in vivo conditions our findings
                  suggest that with respect to inspiratory, post-inspiratory and
                  late-inspiratory neurons, the principle network organization
                  is similar under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

                  motor activities but also to seemingly non-rhythmic behaviors
                  such as sleep, arousal, addiction, memory and cognition. Many
                  of these networks contain pacemaker neurons. The ability of
                  these neurons to generate bursts of activity intrinsically
                  lies in voltage- and time-dependent ion fluxes resulting from
                  a dynamic interplay among ion channels, second messenger
                  pathways and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and is
                  influenced by neuromodulators and synaptic inputs. This
                  complex intrinsic and extrinsic modulation of pacemaker
                  activity exerts a dynamic effect on network activity. The
                  nonlinearity of bursting activity might enable pacemaker

                  of stable neuronal assemblies, i.e. distributed groups of
                  co-active neurons within neuronal networks. It is therefore
                  crucial to monitor distributed patterns of activity in real
                  time with single-neuron resolution. Microelectrode recordings
                  allow detection of coincidence between discharges of
                  identified units at high temporal resolution, but are not able
                  to reveal the full spatial pattern of activity in
                  multi-cellular assemblies. Therefore, observation of such
                  distributed sets of neurons is a stronghold of optical
                  techniques, but the required resolution, sensitivity, and
                  speed are still challenging current technology. Here, we
                  report a new approach for monitoring neuronal assemblies,
                  using memory-related network oscillations in rodent
                  hippocampal circuits as a model. The cytosolic
                  calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein GCaMP3.NES was expressed
                  using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-mediated gene
                  transfer in CA3 pyramidal neurons of cultured mouse
                  hippocampal slices. After 14\textendash{}21 days in culture,
                  field potential recordings revealed spontaneous occurrence of
                  sharp wave-ripple network events during which a fraction of
                  local neurons is coherently activated. Using a custom-built
                  epi-fluorescence microscope we could monitor a field of view
                  of 410 $\mu$m \texttimes{} 410 $\mu$m with single-neuron
                  optical resolution (20 \texttimes{} objective, 0.4 NA). We
                  developed a highly sensitive and specific wavelet-based method
                  of cell identification allowing simultaneous observation of
                  more than 150 neurons at frame rates of up to 60 Hz. Our
                  recording configuration and image analysis provide a tool to

                  following the coactivation of N-methyl-dl-aspartate (NMDA) and
                  5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin or 5-HT) receptors (

                  1473\textendash{}1482). The oscillations are slow
                  ($\approx$0.5 Hz) compared with swimming
                  ($\approx$7\textendash{}35 Hz) raising doubt over their
                  contribution to the cycle by cycle depolarizations occurring
                  during swimming. We investigated an alternative: that the
                  intrinsic oscillations modulate swimming activity over many
                  consecutive cycles. Bath application of NMDA induced
                  continuous fictive swimming that differed between embryonic
                  and larval preparations. In 81\% of larval preparations (n =
                  36), there was a slow (approximately every 2 s) rhythmic
                  modulation of ventral root activity in which burst durations
                  and intensities increased as cycle periods decreased. This
                  pattern of activity was enhanced rather than abolished
                  following blockade of glycine and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid
                  (GABA) A receptors and presumably therefore resulted from a
                  periodic increase in the excitation of motor neurons. To
                  determine whether this slow rhythm resulted from intrinsic,
                  5-HT-dependent membrane potential oscillations, larvae were
                  spinalized to prevent the release of 5-HT from brainstem raphe
                  neurons. The resulting pattern of NMDA-induced activity lacked
                  any slow modulation. The slow modulation could also be
                  enhanced by the bath application of a 5-HT receptor agonist
                  (5-carboxamidotryptamine) and abolished either by the addition
                  of an antagonist (pindobind-5-HT1A) or by removal of magnesium
                  ions, providing more direct evidence for a contribution of
                  intrinsic oscillations. Thus, the 5-HT-dependent intrinsic
                  oscillations modulate NMDA-induced swimming activity over
                  several consecutive cycles.},

                  of Rohon- Beard cells, a class of sensory neurons. In these
                  neurons as well as other primary spinal neurons of Xenopus
                  laevis, the functional differentiation of delayed-rectifier
                  potassium current regulates the waveform of the action
                  potential during the initial day of its appearance. Later, the
                  acquisition of another voltage-dependent potassium
                  current--the A current--plays a major role in regulating
                  excitability. In order to understand the molecular basis of
                  this functional differentiation, genes encoding
                  voltage-dependent potassium currents expressed in the
                  embryonic amphibian nervous system are being cloned. Here, we
                  report the functional properties and developmental
                  localization of a second Xenopus Shaker-like gene (Xenopus Kv
                  1.1; XSha1; GenBank accession number M94258) encoding a
                  potassium current. Homology screening with the mouse gene MBK1
                  led to its isolation. Functional expression in oocytes
                  identifies it as a delayed-rectifier current when assembled as
                  a homooligomeric structure. Specific transcripts corresponding
                  to XSha1 and to the previously cloned gene XSha2 are both
                  detectable by RNase protection in RNA isolated from the
                  embryonic nervous system. However, whole-mount in situ
                  hybridization reveals the temporal pattern and cellular
                  localization of XSha1 but not XSha2 mRNA, suggesting that the
                  concentration of XSha2 transcripts in individual cells is
                  lower than the threshold for detection by this method. Of
                  particular interest, Rohon-Beard cells express XSha1 mRNA. In
                  addition, XSha1 mRNA is detected in several structures
                  containing neural crest derivatives including spinal ganglia,
                  the trigeminal ganglion, and branchial arches; its presence in
                  motor nerves and lateral spinal tracts suggests that both CNS
                  and PNS glia express the mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

                  and three broad cognitive domains (fluid intelligence,

  abstract        = {Embryos spinalized at the 3rd to 6th postotic myotome and
                  immobilized in 10(-4) M tubocurarine can respond to a brief
                  skin stimulus with motor root activity suitable for swimming.
                  Embryos spinalized at the more caudal levels give shorter
                  episodes of fictive swimming. We have previously described the
                  synaptic inputs to motoneurons during fictive swimming in
                  intact embryos (23). In the present paper we look to see if
                  similar synaptic inputs are present in spinal embryos and are
                  therefore spinal in origin. All motoneuron firing during
                  fictive swimming is associated with a tonic depolarization
                  that falls away slowly once firing stops, is increased by
                  hyperpolarizing current, and is reduced by depolarizing
                  current. A slow depolarizing potential evoked by lower levels
                  of skin stimulation has similar properties and rate of fall.
                  In 1-2 mM PDA, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, only a
                  small remnant of the depolarization remains, and motoneuron
                  firing stops. The NMDA antagonist 50 microM APV reduces the
                  depolarization less but also blocks firing. Motoneurons fire
                  one spike per swimming cycle, in phase with nearby motor root
                  discharge. Spikes are preceded by a depolarizing prepotential.
                  This increases with hyperpolarizing current, which can block
                  the spike to reveal an underlying depolarizing potential. In
                  phase with motor root discharge on the opposite side of the
                  body, motoneurons receive a midcycle inhibitory postsynaptic
                  potential, which increases with depolarizing current,
                  decreases with hyperpolarizing current, and is blocked by
                  10(-6) M strychnine. Strychnine, 5 X 10(-7) M, leads first to
                  broadening of motor root bursts then to loss of the
                  alternating swimming pattern of activity, which is replaced by
                  synchronous bursts on both sides of the body. We conclude that
                  the synaptic inputs to motoneurons during fictive swimming in
                  spinal embryos are very similar in properties and pharmacology
                  to those in intact embryos. These inputs, including the tonic
                  depolarization always associated with motoneuron firing during
                  swimming, must be at least partly spinal in origin.},

                  study hatchling Xenopus tadpoles where behavior is controlled
                  by a few thousand neurons but there is a very limited number
                  of types of neuron. Young tadpoles can flex, swim away, adjust
                  their trajectory, speed-up and slow-down, stop when they
                  contact support and struggle when grasped. They are sensitive
                  to touch, pressure, noxious stimuli, light intensity and water
                  currents. Using whole-cell recording has led to rapid progress

                  control swimming but also produce tonic inhibition to reduce
                  responsiveness when the tadpole is at rest. Finally, we
                  analyze the strong alternating struggling movements the
                  tadpole makes when grasped. We show that the mechanisms for
                  rhythm generation here are very different to those during
                  swimming. Although much remains to be explained, study of this
                  simple vertebrate has uncovered basic principles about the
                  function and organization of vertebrate nervous systems.},

  abstract        = {How do the pioneer networks in the axial core of the
                  vertebrate nervous system first develop? Fundamental to
                  understanding any full-scale neuronal network is knowledge of
                  the constituent neurons, their properties, synaptic
                  interconnections, and normal activity. Our novel strategy uses
                  basic developmental rules to generate model networks that
                  retain individual neuron and synapse resolution and are
                  capable of reproducing correct, whole animal responses. We
                  apply our developmental strategy to young Xenopus tadpoles,
                  whose brainstem and spinal cord share a core vertebrate plan,
                  but at a tractable complexity. Following detailed anatomical
                  and physiological measurements to complete a descriptive
                  library of each type of spinal neuron, we build models of
                  their axon growth controlled by simple chemical gradients and
                  physical barriers. By adding dendrites and allowing
                  probabilistic formation of synaptic connections, we
                  reconstruct network connectivity among up to 2000 neurons.
                  When the resulting "network" is populated by model neurons and
                  synapses, with properties based on physiology, it can respond
                  to sensory stimulation by mimicking tadpole swimming behavior.
                  This functioning model represents the most complete
                  reconstruction of a vertebrate neuronal network that can
                  reproduce the complex, rhythmic behavior of a whole animal.
                  The findings validate our novel developmental strategy for
                  generating realistic networks with individual neuron- and
                  synapse-level resolution. We use it to demonstrate how early
                  functional neuronal connectivity and behavior may in life
                  result from simple developmental "rules," which lay out a
                  scaffold for the vertebrate CNS without specific
                  neuron-to-neuron recognition.},

                  after frontal lobe lesions. These deficits appear on a
                  background of reduced fluid intelligence, best measured with
                  tests of novel problem solving. For a range of specific
                  executive tests, we ask how far frontal deficits can be
                  explained by a general fluid intelligence loss. For some
                  widely used tests, e.g. Wisconsin Card Sorting, we find that
                  fluid intelligence entirely explains frontal deficits. When
                  patients and controls are matched on fluid intelligence, no
                  further frontal deficit remains. For these tasks too, deficits
                  are unrelated to lesion location within the frontal lobe. A
                  second group of tasks, including tests of both cognitive (e.g.
                  Hotel, Proverbs) and social (Faux Pas) function, shows a
                  different pattern. Deficits are not fully explained by fluid
                  intelligence and the data suggest association with lesions in
                  the right anterior frontal cortex. Understanding of frontal
                  lobe deficits may be clarified by separating reduced fluid
                  intelligence, important in most or all tasks, from other more
                  specific impairments and their associated regions of damage.},

  abstract        = {Mathematical modeling with delay differential equations
                  (DDEs) is widely used in various application areas of science
                  and engineering (e.g., in semiconductor lasers with delayed
                  feedback, high-speed machining, communication networks, and
                  control systems) and in the life sciences (e.g., in population
                  dynamics, epidemiology, immunology, and physiology). Delay
                  equations have an infinite-dimensional state space because
                  their solution is unique only when an initial function is
                  specified on a time interval of length equal to the largest
                  delay. Consequently, analytical calculations are more
                  difficult than for ordinary differential equations and
                  numerical methods are generally the only way to achieve a
                  complete analysis, prediction and control of systems with time
                  delays. Delay differential equations are a special type of
                  functional differential equation (FDE). In FDEs the time
                  evolution of the state variable can depend on the past in an
                  arbitrary way as long as the dependence is a bounded function
                  of the past. However, DDEs impose a constraint on this
                  dependence, namely that the evolution depends only on certain
                  past values of the state at discrete times. (We do not
                  consider here the case of distributed delay.) The delays can
                  be constant or state dependent. The equations can also involve
                  delayed values of the derivative of the state, which leads to
                  equations of neutral type.},

                  singular perturbation methods have been used to analyze these
                  rhythms. We begin by discussing models for single cells which
                  display bursting oscillations. There are, in fact, several
                  different classes of bursting solutions; these have been
                  classified by the geometric properties of how solutions evolve
                  in phase space. We describe several of the bursting classes
                  and then review related rigorous mathematical analysis. We
                  then discuss the dynamics of small networks of neurons. We are
                  primarily interested in whether excitatory or inhibitory
                  synaptic coupling leads to either synchronous or desynchronous
                  rhythms. We demonstrate that all four combinations are
                  possible, depending on the details of the intrinsic and
                  synaptic properties of the cells. Finally, we discuss larger
                  networks of neuronal oscillators involving two distinct cell
                  populations. In particular, we demonstrate how dynamical
                  systems methods can be used to analyze recent models for sleep
                  rhythms and other oscillations generated in the thalamus. The

  abstract        = {We develop a new computationally efficient approach for the
                  analysis of complex large-scale neurobiological networks. Its
                  key element is the use of a new phenomenological model of a
                  neuron capable of replicating important spike pattern
                  characteristics and designed in the form of a system of
                  difference equations (a map). We developed a set of map-based
                  models that replicate spiking activity of cortical fast
                  spiking, regular spiking and intrinsically bursting neurons.
                  Interconnected with synaptic currents these model neurons
                  demonstrated responses very similar to those found with
                  Hodgkin-Huxley models and in experiments. We illustrate the
                  efficacy of this approach in simulations of one- and
                  two-dimensional cortical network models consisting of regular
                  spiking neurons and fast spiking interneurons to model sleep
                  and activated states of the thalamocortical system. Our study
                  suggests that map-based models can be widely used for
                  large-scale simulations and that such models are especially
                  useful for tasks where the modeling of specific firing
                  patterns of different cell classes is important.},

  abstract        = {The mammalian spinal cord contains a locomotor central
                  pattern generator (CPG) that can produce alternating rhythmic
                  activity of flexor and extensor motoneurones in the absence of
                  rhythmic input and proprioceptive feedback. During such
                  fictive locomotor activity in decerebrate cats, spontaneous
                  omissions of activity occur simultaneously in multiple agonist
                  motoneurone pools for a number of cycles. During these
                  `deletions', antagonist motoneurone pools usually become
                  tonically active but may also continue to be rhythmic. The
                  rhythmic activity that re-emerges following a deletion is
                  often not phase shifted. This suggests that some neuronal
                  mechanism can maintain the locomotor period when motoneurone
                  activity fails. To account for these observations, a
                  simplified computational model of the spinal circuitry has
                  been developed in which the locomotor CPG consists of two
                  levels: a half-centre rhythm generator (RG) and a pattern
                  formation (PF) network, with reciprocal inhibitory
                  interactions between antagonist neural populations at each
                  level. The model represents a network of interacting neural
                  populations with single interneurones and motoneurones
                  described in the Hodgkin-Huxley style. The model reproduces
                  the range of locomotor periods and phase durations observed
                  during real locomotion in adult cats and permits independent
                  control of the level of motoneurone activity and of step cycle
                  timing. By altering the excitability of neural populations
                  within the PF network, the model can reproduce deletions in
                  which motoneurone activity fails but the phase of locomotor
                  oscillations is maintained. The model also suggests criteria
                  for the functional identification of spinal interneurones
                  involved in the mammalian locomotor pattern generation.},

                  explored. In contrast, less is known about central executive
                  processes. Neuroimaging studies suggest that central executive
                  processes are related to a complex fronto-parietal network. In
                  the present study we investigate the question whether varying
                  demands on central executive processes are reflected by
                  differences in coherent activity between and within a

                  visuospatial working memory task. Under an easy executive
                  condition subjects had to mentally imagine previously studied
                  abstract patterns, whereas in the difficult condition,
                  subjects had to mentally manipulate these patterns. The
                  results indicate the involvement of prefrontal areas in
                  executive functions reflected by a decrease of anterior upper
                  alpha short-range connectivity and a parallel increase of

                  electroencephalographic theta frequency range (4-7 Hz) while
                  subjects executed complex sequential finger movements with
                  varying task difficulty and memory load. Local frontal-midline
                  theta activity was associated with the general level of
                  cognitive demand, with the highest amplitudes in the most
                  demanding condition. Using low-resolution electromagnetic
                  tomography analysis (LORETA), this theta activity was
                  localized in the anterior cingulate gyrus including the
                  cingulate motor area. These results suggest that local theta
                  activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus represents correlates
                  of an attentional system that allocate cognitive resources. In
                  addition, interregional connectivity in the theta frequency
                  range was modulated by memory-related executive functions
                  independently of task difficulty. Connectivity analyses

                  frontal and parietal cortices during execution of novel
                  compared with well-trained finger movement sequences. Thus,
                  these results are compatible with a model in which theta

  abstract        = {Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that (1) NMDA
                  receptor activation occurs during locomotor network operation
                  in lower and higher vertebrates and (2) NMDA induces active
                  membrane properties that can be expressed as intrinsic voltage
                  fluctuations in cells located in the spinal cord of lower
                  vertebrates, as well as in neurons located in supraspinal
                  regions of the mammalian nervous system. This paper reviews
                  recent data showing that NMDA can induce similiar inherent
                  membrane potential behavior in synaptically isolated
                  motoneurons and interneurons in the mammalian (in vitro
                  neonatal rat) spinal cord. These TTX-resistant voltage
                  fluctuations include rhythmic oscillations and plateau
                  potentials, as well as low-frequency long-lasting voltage
                  shifts (LLVSs). 5-HT facilitates the transformation of LLVSs
                  into oscillatory events, and 5-HT receptor antagonists have
                  the reverse effect. In the absence of TTX, locomotor-related
                  rhythmic drive potentials in spinal cord neurons can display
                  nonlinear voltage behavior compatible with NMDA receptor
                  activation, although other voltage-activated conductances are
                  not excluded. Suppression of the nonlinear voltage response
                  associated with NMDA receptor activation, via removal of Mg2+,
                  disrupts locomotor patterns of network activity. The potential
                  role of NMDA receptor activation in the operation of mammalian
                  locomotor networks is discussed in the context of these recent
                  observations.},

                  to toxins and chemical agents. For that reason,
                  characterization of these patterns is important for the

                  firing modes to sinusoidal current injection and performed
                  Fourier analysis on these responses. For comparison, we
                  constructed a minimal "integrate-and-fire-or-burst" (IFB)
                  neuron model that reproduces salient features of the relay
                  cell responses. The IFB model is constrained to quantitatively
                  fit our Fourier analysis of experimental relay neuron
                  responses, including: the temporal tuning of the response in
                  both tonic and burst modes, including a finding of low-pass
                  and sometimes broadband behavior of tonic firing and band-pass
                  characteristics during bursting, and the generally greater
                  linearity of tonic compared with burst responses at low
                  frequencies. In tonic mode, both experimental and theoretical
                  responses display a frequency-dependent transition from
                  massively superharmonic spiking to phase-locked superharmonic
                  spiking near 3 Hz, followed by phase-locked subharmonic
                  spiking at higher frequencies. Subharmonic and superharmonic
                  burst responses also were observed experimentally.
                  Characterizing the response properties of the "tuned" IFB

                  dependence of burst versus tonic response mode in relay
                  neurons. Furthermore the simplicity of the IFB model makes it

                  Xenopus spinal cord neurons that are rhythmically active
                  during fictive swimming and presumed to be motoneurons.
                  Resting potentials and input resistances of such neurons are
                  -75 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 2 mV (mean \$$\backslash$pm\$ standard
                  error) and 118 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 17 M$\Omega$ respectively.
                  Most cells fire a single impulse, 0.5 to 2.0 ms in duration
                  and 48.5 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 1.8 mV in amplitude, in response
                  to a depolarizing current step. A minority fire several spikes
                  of diminishing amplitude to more strongly depolarizing
                  current. Cells held above spike, threshold fire on rebound
                  from brief hyperpolarizing pulses. Spikes are blocked by 0.1
                  to 1.0 $\mu$M tetrodotoxin (TTX) and are therefore
                  Na+-dependent. Current/voltage (I/V) plots to injected current
                  are approximately linear near the resting potential but become
                  non-linear at more depolarized levels. Cells recorded in TTX
                  with CsCl-filled microelectrodes show a linearized I/V plot at
                  depolarized membrane potentials suggesting the normal presence
                  of a voltage-dependent K+ conductance activated at relatively
                  depolarized levels. Most cells recorded in this way but
                  without TTX fire long trains of spikes of near constant
                  amplitude, pointing to a role of the K+ conductance in
                  limiting firing in normal cells. Spike blockage with TTX
                  reveals, in some cells, a transient depolarizing
                  Cd2+-sensitive and therefore presumably Ca2+-dependent
                  potential that increases in amplitude with depolarization.
                  Cells in TTX, Cd2+, and strychnine, and recorded with
                  CsCl-filled microelectrodes to block active conductances
                  respond to hyperpolarizing current steps with a two component
                  exponential response. The cell time constant ($\tau$0)
                  obtained from the longer of these by exponential peeling is
                  relatively long (mean 15.7 ms). These findings contribute to
                  an increased understanding of the cellular properties involved
                  in spinal rhythm generation in this simple vertebrate.},

                  swimming and struggling. Both can be generated by spinal cord
                  circuitry and evoked by stimulation of a single skin sensory
                  pathway (Soffe, 1991b). This presents a valuable opportunity
                  to explore mechanisms for vertebrate motor pattern switching.
                  Swimming and struggling have been compared using intracellular
                  recording from spinal neurons in immobilized embryos.
                  Underlying synaptic drive was similar; motoneurons and
                  premotor interneurons were excited in phase with ipsilateral
                  motor root discharge and inhibited in phase with contralateral
                  motor root discharge. Excitation was stronger during
                  struggling and associated with short bursts of impulses,
                  contrasting with single spikes per cycle during swimming.
                  Excitation was reduced in both patterns by local application
                  of 1 mM kynurenic acid, indicating excitatory amino acid
                  mediation. Inhibition was antagonized by 1 microM strychnine,
                  indicating glycine mediation. Many motoneurons (76\%) and
                  premotor interneurons (68\%) fired during both swimming and
                  struggling, including examples of all three spinal premotor
                  interneuron classes. Most of the remaining motoneurons (20\%)
                  and premotor interneurons (24\%) fired only during struggling,
                  providing roughly 30\% more active neurons than during
                  swimming. To investigate whether new neuronal classes become
                  active during struggling, recordings were made from sensory
                  neurons and sensory interneurons. Rohon-Beard sensory neurons
                  did not fire during either swimming or struggling.
                  Dorsolateral commissural sensory interneurons received
                  rhythmic, strychnine-sensitive inhibition during both swimming
                  and struggling and also did not fire. Neither of these
                  neuronal classes is therefore recruited to the circuitry for
                  struggling. Although behaviorally distinct, Xenopus embryo
                  swimming and struggling motor patterns appear to employ
                  similar synaptic drive. I propose that this reflects the
                  common nature of much of the premotor circuitry that drives
                  them. Extra neurons are recruited to this circuitry during
                  struggling, but only from within classes that also participate
                  in swimming.},

                  different motor patterns in vertebrates are poorly understood.
                  Immobilized, spinal Xenopus embryos are used here to examine
                  the motor patterns evoked by various concentrations of
                  excitatory amino acids. 2. Relatively low concentrations of
                  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (40-60 microM), kainate (7-8
                  microM), and
                  alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) (5
                  microM) evoked motor root discharge characteristic of
                  swimming. Brief applications of higher concentrations of
                  kainate (20-40 microM), AMPA (25-30 microM), quisqualate (5
                  microM), and glutamate (1-4 mM) evoked sequences of a
                  different motor pattern: struggling. This is characterized by
                  a longer cycle period, increased burst duration, and a
                  reversed longitudinal pattern of motor root discharge. The
                  struggling pattern was never evoked by higher concentrations
                  of NMDA (300-500 microM), but was evoked by 30 microM AMPA or
                  5 microM quisqualate in the presence of 50 microM
                  D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. 3. Intracellular
                  recordings from presumed spinal motoneurons showed different
                  patterns of activity during agonist-evoked swimming and
                  struggling. The patterns were like those described previously
                  during sensory-evoked behavior. 4. Caudal applications of
                  excitatory amino acids that produced struggling discharge did
                  so only at caudal motor roots, whereas caudal applications of
                  NMDA evoked swimming activity throughout the spinal cord. 5.
                  During excitatory-amino-acid-evoked struggling, sensory
                  Rohon-Beard neurons depolarized up to 7 mV, but did not fire.
                  6. The results show that expression of the struggling pattern,
                  like swimming, is not critically dependent on sensory
                  discharge. The results are also consistent with the idea that
                  expression of the two very different motor patterns for
                  swimming or struggling in this simple vertebrate preparation
                  can be controlled by the level of excitation within the spinal
                  motor circuitry, and need not involve the activity of a
                  specific external neuromodulator.},

                  activities of neural system and plays an important role in
                  signal encoding and transmission. In the present paper, a
                  neural network with delay coupling is modeled to investigate
                  the generation mechanism of bursting behavior. The
                  Andronov-Hopf bifurcation is firstly studied and then the
                  degenerated Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, namely Bautin
                  bifurcation, is analyzed with the external input varying.
                  Classifying dynamics in the neighborhood of the Bautin
                  bifurcation, we obtain the bifurcation sets where the
                  supercritical/subcritical Andronov-Hopf, or the fold limit
                  cycle bifurcation may happen in the system under
                  consideration. For a periodic disturbance occurring in the
                  neighborhood of the Bautin bifurcation, it is seen that the
                  Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and fold limit cycle bifurcation may
                  lead to the transition from quiescent state to firing
                  activities. Complex bursting phenomena, including Hopf/Hopf
                  bursting, Hopf/Fold cycle bursting, SubHopf/Hopf bursting and
                  SubHopf/Fold cycle bursting are found in the firing area. The
                  results show that the dynamical properties of different
                  burstings are related to the dynamical behaviors derived from
                  the bifurcations of the system. Finally, it is seen that the
                  bursting disappears but the periodic spiking appears in the
                  delayed neural network for large values of delay.},

                  collective cell motion, driven by migratory behaviours of
                  individual cells and their interactions with the extracellular
                  environment. An outstanding question is how cells regulate
                  their internal driving forces to maintain tissue cohesiveness
                  while promoting the requisite fluidity for collective motion.
                  Progress has been limited by the lack of an integrative
                  framework that couples cellular physical behavior with
                  stochastic biochemical dynamics underlying cell motion and
                  adhesion. Here we develop a cell-based computational model for
                  collective cell migration during epithelial wound repair that
                  integrates tissue mechanics with active cell motility,
                  cell-substrate adhesions, and actomyosin dynamics. Using this
                  model we show that an optimum balance of protrusive cell
                  crawling and actomyosin contractility drives rapid directed
                  motion of cohesive cell groups, robust to variations in cell
                  and substrate physical properties. We further show that
                  disparate modes of individual cell migration can cooperate to
                  accelerate collective cell migration by fluidizing confluent
                  tissues.},

  abstract        = {The presence of subgroups in vomeronasal sensory neurons
                  has been known in various animals. To elucidate possible
                  functional subdivisions in the guinea-pig accessory olfactory
                  bulb, the combined studies with GTP-binding protein
                  immunohistochemistry, electrophysiological and optical
                  recordings were carried out. Gi2 alpha and Go alpha proteins
                  were immunohistochemically localized, respectively, in the
                  anterior and posterior regions of the vomeronasal nerve and
                  glomerular layers, indicating that the guinea-pig accessory
                  olfactory bulb receives at least two different inputs. This
                  suggests that an anatomical boundary exists in these two
                  layers. A mapping study of field potentials in sagittal slice
                  preparations demonstrated that stimulation of the anterior
                  vomeronasal nerve layer elicited field potentials with weak
                  oscillatory responses exclusively in the anterior region of
                  the external plexiform layer, whereas shocks to the posterior
                  vomeronasal nerve layer provoked distinct oscillatory
                  responses within the posterior one. The damping factors of
                  oscillations in the anterior and posterior regions were
                  0.064+/-0.028 and 0.025+/-0.014, respectively. These
                  electrophysiological results suggest that the accessory
                  olfactory bulb consists of two functionally different
                  subdivisions. Real-time optical imaging showed that anterior
                  vomeronasal nerve layer shocks produced neural activity which
                  spread horizontally from anterior to posterior only within the
                  anterior region of the external plexiform and mitral cell
                  layers, whereas shocks to the posterior vomeronasal nerve
                  layer evoked periodic neural activity which spread
                  horizontally from posterior to anterior only within the
                  posterior region. Furthermore, the most posterior extent of
                  the optical response evoked in the anterior region immediately
                  adjoined the most anterior extent of that evoked in the
                  posterior region. The maximal distance of signal propagation
                  in the granule cell layer corresponded to that in the
                  overlying external plexiform and mitral cell layers,
                  indicating that the granule cell layer also has a similar
                  boundary. Thus, these optical imaging studies not only
                  demonstrated a precise boundary in each layer of the accessory
                  olfactory bulb, which was positioned right beneath the
                  boundary defined by GTP-binding protein immunohistochemistry,
                  but also confirmed the observations from electrophysiological
                  mapping that evoked field potentials are independently
                  distributed in each of two subdivisions. The presence of the
                  functional subdivision in each layer leads us to conclude that
                  the accessory olfactory bulb in the guinea-pig is distinctly
                  segregated into the anterior and posterior subdivisions, and
                  to suggest that there are at least two different input output
                  pathways in the vomeronasal system.},

                  total outward current in the larval and embryonic neurons
                  remained the same from stage 37/38 to stage 42. * 3Almost all
                  neurons at stage 42 expressed a fast activating Ca2+-dependent
                  K+ current (IKCa) that was largely absent from embryonic
                  neurons. Whereas IKCa became larger and more prevalent during
                  development, the delayed rectifier K+ currents were
                  down-regulated. * 4About 53\% of IKCa was selectively blocked
                  by iberiotoxin which had no effect on the delayed rectifier K+
                  currents or the K+ currents of embryonic neurons. * 5The
                  firing properties of neurons isolated from embryos were
                  unchanged by iberiotoxin. However, the toxin greatly increased
                  the frequency of firing in larval neurons. * 6Iberiotoxin
                  extended the duration of ventral root bursts during fictive
                  swimming in larvae at stages 41 and 42 but had no effect at
                  stage 40. The progressive expression of IKCa thus contributed
                  to burst termination. * 7We have found that changes in
                  expression of outward current closely correlate with the
                  maturation of the motor pattern during development. At a time
                  when the motor pattern has a need for a burst-terminating
                  mechanism, the larval neurons express a channel with
                  properties appropriate for such a role.},

                  memory is associated with the integrity of white matter in the
                  frontoparietal regions. It is unknown to what extent the
                  integrity of white matter underlying the working memory system
                  is plastic. Using voxel-based analysis (VBA) of fractional
                  anisotropy (FA) measures of fiber tracts, we investigated the
                  effect of working memory training on structural connectivity

                  underlie previously reported improvement of working memory

                  of a modulation of intrinsic membrane properties. The role
                  calcium-dependent potassium channels, KCa, in the lamprey
                  locomotor system has been investigated extensively. Earlier
                  experimental studies have shown that apamin, which affects one
                  type of KCa, increases the cycle duration of the locomotor
                  network, due to effects on the burst termination. The effects
                  of apamin were here larger when the network had a low level of
                  activity (burst frequency 0.5 to 1 Hz) as compared to a higher
                  rate ($>$2 Hz). By using a previously developed simulation
                  model based on the lamprey locomotor network, we show that the
                  model could account for the frequency dependence of the apamin
                  modulation, if only the KCa conductance activated by Ca2+
                  entering during the action potential was altered and not the
                  KCa conductance activated by Ca2+ entering through NMDA
                  channels. The present simulation model of the spinal network
                  in the lamprey can thus account for earlier experimental
                  results with apamin on the network and cellular level that

                  critically-important concepts to undergraduate students of
                  mathematics, engineering and the sciences. The book begins
                  with a section that examines the origin of differential
                  equations, defines basic terms and outlines the general
                  solution of a differential equation-the solution that actually
                  contains every solution of such an equation. Subsequent
                  sections deal with such subjects as: integrating factors;
                  dilution and accretion problems; the algebra of complex
                  numbers; the linearization of first order systems; Laplace
                  Transforms; Newton's Interpolation Formulas; and Picard's
                  Method of Successive Approximations. The book contains two
                  exceptional chapters: one on series methods of solving
                  differential equations, the second on numerical methods of
                  solving differential equations. The first includes a
                  discussion of the Legendre Differential Equation, Legendre
                  Functions, Legendre Polynomials, the Bessel Differential
                  Equation, and the Laguerre Differential Equation. Throughout
                  the book, every term is clearly defined and every theorem
                  lucidly and thoroughly analyzed, and there is an admirable
                  balance between the theory of differential equations and their
                  application. An abundance of solved problems and practice
                  exercises enhances the value of Ordinary Differential
                  Equations as a classroom text for undergraduate students and
                  teaching professionals. The book concludes with an in-depth
                  examination of existence and uniqueness theorems about a
                  variety of differential equations, as well as an introduction
                  to the theory of determinants and theorems about Wronskians.},

                  bursting solutions, and, for different values of the
                  parameters, the bursting solutions give way to continuous
                  spiking. Numerical results have demonstrated that during the
                  transition from bursting to continuous spiking, the system of
                  equations may give rise to very complicated dynamics. The
                  mathematical mechanism responsible for this dynamics is
                  described. We prove that during the transition from bursting
                  to continuous spiking the system must undergo a large number
                  of bifurcations. After each bifurcation the system is
                  increasingly chaotic in the sense that the maximal invariant
                  set of a certain two-dimensional map is topologically
                  equivalent to the shift on a larger set of symbols. The number

                  subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the globus
                  pallidus in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia.
                  Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the
                  roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and
                  associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity
                  patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the
                  relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can
                  support three general classes of sustained firing patterns:
                  clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may
                  show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern
                  can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We
                  characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well
                  as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking

                  rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of
                  activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to,
                  and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect
                  pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular
                  to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence

                  formed as neuronal networks develop and can simple rules
                  account for the formation of functioning circuits? These
                  questions are assessed in the spinal circuits controlling
                  swimming in hatchling frog tadpoles. This is possible because
                  detailed information is now available on the identity and
                  synaptic connections of the main types of neuron. Results: The
                  probabilities of synapses between 7 types of identified spinal
                  neuron were measured directly by making electrical recordings
                  from 500 pairs of neurons. For the same neuron types, the
                  dorso-ventral distributions of axons and dendrites were
                  measured and then used to calculate the probabilities that
                  axons would encounter particular dendrites and so potentially
                  form synaptic connections. Surprisingly, synapses were found
                  between all types of neuron but contact probabilities could be
                  predicted simply by the anatomical overlap of their axons and
                  dendrites. These results suggested that synapse formation may
                  not require axons to recognise specific, correct dendrites. To
                  test the plausibility of simpler hypotheses, we first made
                  computational models that were able to generate longitudinal
                  axon growth paths and reproduce the axon distribution patterns
                  and synaptic contact probabilities found in the spinal cord.
                  To test if probabilistic rules could produce functioning
                  spinal networks, we then made realistic computational models
                  of spinal cord neurons, giving them established cell-specific
                  properties and connecting them into networks using the contact
                  probabilities we had determined. A majority of these networks
                  produced robust swimming activity. Conclusion: Simple factors
                  such as morphogen gradients controlling dorso-ventral soma,
                  dendrite and axon positions may sufficiently constrain the
                  synaptic connections made between different types of neuron as
                  the spinal cord first develops and allow functional networks
                  to form. Our analysis implies that detailed cellular
                  recognition between spinal neuron types may not be necessary
                  for the reliable formation of functional networks to generate
                  early behaviour like swimming.},

                  and must therefore have robust repair mechanisms. The
                  behaviour of tissues depends on their mechanical properties
                  and those of the surrounding environment. However, it remains
                  poorly understood how tissue mechanics regulates wound
                  healing, particularly in in vivo animal tissues. Here we show
                  that by tuning epithelial cell junctional tension, we can
                  alter the rate of wound healing. We observe cells moving past
                  each other at the wound edge by intercalating, like molecules
                  in a fluid, resulting in seamless wound closure. Using a
                  computational model, we counterintuitively predict that an
                  increase in tissue fluidity, via a reduction in junctional
                  tension, can accelerate the rate of wound healing. This is
                  contrary to previous evidence that actomyosin tensile
                  structures are important for wound closure. When we
                  experimentally reduce tissue tension, cells intercalate faster
                  and wounds close in less time. The role we describe for tissue
                  fluidity in wound healing, in addition to its known roles in
                  developing and mature tissues, reinforces the importance of
                  the fluid state of a tissue.},

                  The axon initial segment, the proposed site of action
                  potential generation, usually emanates directly from the soma.
                  However, we found that axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells
                  frequently derive from a basal dendrite rather than from the
                  soma. This morphology is particularly enriched in central CA1,
                  the principal hippocampal output area. Multiphoton glutamate
                  uncaging revealed that input onto the axon-carrying dendrites
                  (AcDs) was more efficient in eliciting action potential output
                  than input onto regular basal dendrites. First, synaptic input
                  onto AcDs generates action potentials with lower activation
                  thresholds compared with regular dendrites. Second, AcDs are
                  intrinsically more excitable, generating dendritic spikes with
                  higher probability and greater strength. Thus, axon-carrying
                  dendrites constitute a privileged channel for excitatory
                  synaptic input in a subset of cortical pyramidal cells. Video

                  efficient, morphologically inspired ``Reduced Model'' to
                  expedite tuning the model to produce endogenous bursting and
                  alternating bursting when configured as a half-center
                  oscillator (paired with reciprocally inhibitory synapses). To
                  find conductance density distributions that produce endogenous
                  bursting, we implemented a genetic algorithm automated
                  parameter search. With multiple searches, we found eight
                  parameter sets that produced endogenous bursting in the
                  Reduced Model. When these parameter sets were applied to the
                  Full Model, all produced endogenous bursting, although when

                  parameter sets produced sustained bursting in the Reduced

                  with the same level of morphological detail. This implies that
                  morphological detail can affect burst activity and that these
                  parameter sets may represent different mechanisms for burst
                  generation and/or regulation. We also tested the models with
                  parameter variations that correspond to experimental
                  manipulations. We conclude that, whereas similar output can be
                  achieved with multiple different parameter sets, perturbations
                  such as conductance variations can highlight differences.
                  Additionally, this work demonstrates both the utility and
                  limitations of using simplified models to represent more
                  morphologically accurate models.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in vitro and in vivo have epochs of bursting or
                  ``up state'' activity during which firing rates are
                  dramatically elevated. Various methods of detecting bursts in
                  extracellular spike trains have appeared in the literature,
                  the most widely used apparently being Poisson Surprise (PS). A
                  natural description of the phenomenon assumes (1) there are
                  two hidden states, which we label ``burst'' and ``non-burst,''
                  (2) the neuron evolves stochastically, switching at random
                  between these two states, and (3) within each state the spike
                  train follows a time-homogeneous point process. If in (2) the
                  transitions from non-burst to burst and burst to non-burst
                  states are memoryless, this becomes a hidden Markov model
                  (HMM). For HMMs, the state transitions follow exponential
                  distributions, and are highly irregular. Because observed
                  bursting may in some cases be fairly
                  regular\textemdash{}exhibiting inter-burst intervals with
                  small variation\textemdash{}we relaxed this assumption. When
                  more general probability distributions are used to describe
                  the state transitions the two-state point process model
                  becomes a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We developed an
                  efficient Bayesian computational scheme to fit HSMMs to spike
                  train data. Numerical simulations indicate the method can
                  perform well, sometimes yielding very different results than
                  those based on PS.},

                  potentials given a sufficiently large simultaneous recording
                  sample. A sequence of action potentials (spike train) often
                  has high frequency spike episodes that are generally called
                  bursts. However, bursts are difficult to quantify and require
                  operational definitions that reflect the type of activity and
                  the interest of the experimenter. This paper presents a simple
                  method for defining bursts as strings of spikes with only two
                  parameters: a minimum number of spikes per burst and a maximum
                  interspike interval. These two values represent a simple
                  parameterization that is adequate for the description of
                  temporal grouping in spike trains. Because this method has a
                  minimal computation time, it allows implementation of burst
                  analysis in real-time, including statistical changes in burst
                  variables, histograms of burst types, and patterns in

                  activating Ca(2+)-dependent outward current which was revealed
                  either by removal of external Ca2+ or by the addition of the
                  Ca2+ channel blocker, 150 microM Cd2+. 2. The Ca(2+)-sensitive
                  current was very slow to activate and had a mean time constant
                  of activation of 437 ms at 0 mV. The current also had very
                  long tail currents which were blocked by Cd2+. The rate of
                  decay of the slowest component of the Ca(2+)-dependent tail
                  currents was insensitive to membrane potential suggesting that
                  the relaxation of the Ca(2+)-dependent current may only be
                  weakly voltage dependent. 3. The reversal potential of the
                  Ca(2+)-sensitive tail currents depended on the concentration
                  of external K+ in a manner predicted by the Nernst equation.
                  Thus the Ca(2+)-sensitive current was carried by K+. 4. The
                  toxin apamin (10 nM to 2 microM) selectively blocked the
                  Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current without affecting voltage-gated K+
                  currents. This current may be analogous to a small-conductance
                  Ca(2+)-dependent K+ (SK) current; however, unlike some SK
                  currents, the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current was also sensitive
                  to 500 microM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA). 5.
                  Applications of 10 nM apamin to spinalized embryos did not
                  perturb the motor pattern for swimming. However, the cycle
                  periods over which the locomotor rhythm generator could
                  generate appropriate motor activity were lengthened by about
                  10\% and the mean duration of swimming episodes was increased
                  by approximately 40\%. 6. We therefore propose that the
                  Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current plays an important role in the
                  self-termination of motor activity.},

                  locomotor activity in the isolated spinal cord preparation of
                  the lamprey, as well as TTX-resistant membrane potential
                  oscillations in many individual neurons. This inherent
                  oscillatory activity is shown to depend on a specific
                  activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. This
                  activation initiates voltage-dependent, magnesium- requiring
                  membrane potential bistability, presumably due to a
                  development of a region of negative slope conductance in the
                  current- voltage relation of the neuron. When sodium ions were
                  removed from the bathing solution, oscillations disappeared,
                  and the membrane potential was maintained at a hyperpolarized
                  level, suggesting that the depolarizing current during the
                  oscillatory cycle is mainly carried by sodium ions. Replacing
                  Ca2+ with Ba2+ also leads to a cessation of oscillatory
                  activity, with the membrane potential remaining at the more
                  depolarized level. This indicates an involvement of a
                  Ca2+-dependent K+ current during the repolarization phase.
                  These findings, together with the voltage dependence, can
                  account for the main characteristics of the NMDA
                  receptor-induced, TTX-resistant membrane potential
                  oscillations. This oscillatory behavior has been demonstrated
                  in motoneurons and in several interneurons including CC
                  interneurons but has not been found in edge cells, dorsal
                  cells, or lateral interneurons. The possibility that inherent
                  oscillatory membrane properties may contribute to the activity
                  pattern during fictive locomotion was investigated in
                  experiments with intracellular current injection in the
                  absence of TTX. The stimulation effects obtained required the
                  presence of magnesium ions and were analogous to the
                  stimulation effects seen during oscillations after TTX
                  blockade. Together with similarities in, for instance,
                  frequency and amplitude between the locomotor oscillatory
                  activity and the TTX-resistant oscillations, the results are
                  compatible with an involvement of inherent, oscillatory
                  membrane properties during fictive locomotion in the lamprey
                  spinal cord.},

                  109\textendash{}113]. The bursting mechanism involves a
                  ``ping-pong'' interplay between soma-to-dendrite back
                  propagation of action potentials and an afterdepolarization
                  generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and a somatic
                  Na+ window current. The oscillation period is primarily
                  determined by a slowly inactivating K+ channel and passive
                  membrane properties. The model behavior is compared
                  quantitatively with the experimental data. It is shown that
                  the cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation can transform
                  the model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to rapid
                  bursting, as a possible pathway for acetylcholine to promote
                  40-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex. To explore possible
                  functions of fast burst firing in the neocortex, a
                  hypothetical neural pair is simulated, where a chattering cell
                  is presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via stochastic
                  synapses. For this purpose, we use a synapse model endowed
                  with a low release probability, short-term facilitation and
                  vesicle depletion. This synapse model reproduces the behavior
                  of certain neocortical pyramid-to-interneuron synapses
                  [Thomson A. M.et al. (1993) Neuroscience54,
                  347\textendash{}360]. We showed that the burstiness of cell
                  firing is required for the rhythmicity to be reliably
                  transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable synapses,
                  and that fast burst firing of chattering neurons can provide
                  an exceptionally powerful drive for recruiting feedback
                  inhibition in cortical circuits. From these results, we
                  propose that the fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical
                  chattering neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic
                  mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair highlight
                  the importance of characterizing the short-term plasticity of
                  the synaptic connections made by chattering cells, in order to
                  understand their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma

                  extensively as a model system for investigating the networks
                  underlying vertebrate motor behavior. The locomotor networks
                  can be activated by application of glutamate agonists, such as
                  N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), to the isolated spinal cord
                  preparation. Many spinal neurons are capable of generating
                  pacemaker-like membrane potential oscillations upon activation
                  of NMDA receptors. These oscillations rely on the
                  voltage-dependent properties of NMDA receptors in interaction
                  with voltage-dependent potassium and calcium-dependent
                  potassium (KCa) channels, as well as low voltage-activated
                  calcium channels. Upon membrane depolarization, influx of
                  calcium will activate KCa channels, which in turn, will
                  contribute to repolarization and termination of the
                  depolarized phase. The appearance of the NMDA-induced
                  oscillations varies markedly between spinal cord preparations;
                  they may either have a pronounced, depolarized plateau phase
                  or be characterized by a short-lasting depolarization lasting
                  approximately 200\textendash{}300 ms without a plateau. Both
                  types of oscillations increase in frequency with increased
                  concentrations of NMDA. Here, we characterize these two types
                  of membrane potential oscillations and show that they depend
                  on the level of endogenous release of 5-HT in the spinal cord
                  preparations. In the lamprey, 5-HT acts to block
                  voltage-dependent calcium channels and will thereby modulate
                  the activity of KCa channels. When 5-HT antagonists were
                  administered, the plateau-like oscillations were converted to
                  the second type of oscillations lacking a plateau phase.
                  Conversely, plateau-like oscillations can be induced or
                  prolonged by 5-HT agonists. These properties are most likely
                  of significance for the modulatory action of 5-HT on the
                  spinal networks for locomotion.},

                  and either a potassium current or an inwardly rectifying
                  cation current can generate subthreshold oscillations were
                  analyzed using nonlinear dynamical techniques applied to a
                  neuronal model consisting of two differential equations.
                  Mathematical descriptions of the membrane currents were
                  derived using voltage-clamp data collected from entorhinal
                  cortical neurons. A bifurcation analysis was performed using
                  applied current as the control parameter to map the range of
                  magnitudes of the sodium, potassium/cation, and leakage
                  conductances over which subthreshold oscillations exist. The
                  threshold of the potassium/cation current was an important
                  determinant of the robustness of oscillatory behavior. The
                  activation time constant of the potassium/cation current
                  largely determined the frequency range of emergent
                  oscillations. This result implicates the slow inward rectifier
                  or an as yet undescribed slow outward current in entorhinal
                  cortical oscillations; the latter explanation, while more
                  speculative, is more consistent with the pharmacological
                  properties of subthreshold oscillations and gives oscillations
                  over a larger current range. The shallowness of the sodium
                  activation curve confined emergent oscillations to rise
                  gradually rather than abruptly and extended the current range
                  over which the model oscillated.},

  abstract        = {Nonlinear dynamics of lasers has been a lively theoretical
                  and experimental field since the invention of the laser in
                  1960. Its focus in the last two decades have been
                  instabilities in widely used semiconductor lasers. Nonlinear
                  studies of laser systems contributed to the field of dynamical
                  systems with general phenomena including chaos, (chaotic)
                  synchronization of coupled oscillators, competition,
                  excitability, delay-induced instabilities, unfolding of
                  high-codimension bifurcations, bifurcation cascades, and
                  spatial patterns; see [1, 28, 30, 36, 51, 63] for general
                  reading and further references. These studies also deepened
                  the understanding of nonlinear phenomena that are important
                  for technological applications, e.g. external-modulation
                  response of semiconductor lasers for faster Internet
                  connections [57].Furthermore, nonlinear analysis of laser
                  systems stimulated and helped to validate the feasibility of
                  novel, chaos-based applications including secure communication
                  schemes [4, 50], chaotic radars [34], and instability-based
                  laser sensors [56].},
