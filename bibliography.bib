  note         = {1. The ionic currents in the lateral pyloric (LP)
                  cell of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) described
                  in the preceding paper of the rock crab Cancer
                  borealis were fit with a set of differential
                  equations that describe their voltage, time, and
                  Ca2+ dependence. The voltage-dependent currents
                  modeled are a delayed rectifier-like current, id; a
                  Ca(2+)-activated outward current, io(Ca); a
                  transient A-like current, iA; a Ca2+ current, iCa;
                  an inwardly rectifying current, ih; and a fast
                  tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ current, iNa. 2. A
                  single-compartment, isopotential model of the LP
                  cell was constructed from the six voltage-dependent
                  currents, a voltage-independent leak current il, a
                  Ca2+ buffering system, and the membrane
                  capacitance. 3. The behavior of the model LP neuron
                  was compared with that of the biological neuron by
                  simulating physiological experiments carried out in
                  both voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes. The
                  model and biological neurons show similar
                  action-potential shapes, durations, steady-state
                  current-voltage (I-V) curves, and respond to
                  injected current in a comparable way.},

  abstract     = {We present a theoretical model which is used to
                  explain the intersegmental coordination of the
                  neural networks responsible for generating
                  locomotion in the isolated spinal cord of lamprey. A
                  simplified mathematical model of a limit cycle
                  oscillator is presented which consists of only a
                  single dependent variable, the phase
                  \texttheta(t). By coupling N such oscillators
                  together we are able to generate stable phase locked
                  motions which correspond to traveling waves in the
                  spinal cord, thus simulating ``fictive
                  swimming''. We are also able to generate irregular
                  ``drifting'' motions which are compared to the
                  experimental data obtained from cords with selective
                  surgical lesions.},

                  experimentally observed thalamocortical relay neuron
                  response properties, including the temporal tuning
                  of both tonic spiking (i.e., conventional action
                  potentials) and post-inhibitory rebound bursting
                  mediated by the low-threshold Ca2+ current, IT. In
                  previous work focusing on experimental and IFB model
                  responses to sinusoidal current injection, large
                  regions of stimulus parameter space were observed
                  for which the response was entrained to periodic
                  applied current, resulting in repetitive burst,
                  tonic, or mixed (i.e., burst followed by tonic)
                  responses. Here we present an exact analysis of such
                  mode-locking in the integrate-and-fire-or-burst
                  model under the influence of arbitrary periodic
                  forcing that includes sinusoidally driven responses
                  as one case. In this analysis, the instabilities of
                  mode-locked states are identified as both smooth
                  bifurcations of an associated firing time map and
                  nonsmooth bifurcations of the underlying
                  discontinuous flow. The explicit construction of
                  borders in parameter space that define the
                  instabilities of mode-locked zones is used to build
                  up the Arnol'd tongue structure for the model. The
                  zones for mode-locking are shown to be in excellent
                  agreement with numerical simulations and are used to
                  explore the observed stimulus dependence of burst
                  versus tonic response of the IFB neuron model.},

                  neuron allows it to fire a burst of spikes in
                  response to a depolarizing signal, so that it mimics
                  the behavior of a reticular (RE) cell. Within a

                  with on-center excitation can support a fast
                  traveling pulse. In contrast, a network of
                  inhibitory TC cells is found to support a slowly
                  propagating lurching pulse.},

  abstract     = {Rhythmic activity within the heartbeat pattern
                  generator of the medicinal leech is based on the
                  alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory pairs of
                  oscillator heart interneurons (half-center
                  oscillators). Bicuculline methiodide has been shown
                  to block mutual inhibition between these
                  interneurons and to cause them to spike tonically
                  while recorded intracellularly (Schmidt and
                  Calabrese, 1992). Using extracellular recording
                  techniques, we show here that oscillator and
                  premotor heart interneurons continue to burst when
                  pharmacologically isolated with bicuculline,
                  although the bursting is not robust in some
                  preparations. We propose that a nonspecific leak
                  current introduced by the intracellular
                  microelectrode suppresses endogenous bursting
                  activity to account for the discrepancy with results
                  using intracellular recording. A two-parameter
                  bifurcation diagram (E leak vsg leak) of a
                  mathematical model of a single heart interneuron
                  shows a narrow stripe of parameter values where
                  bursting occurs, separating large zones of tonic
                  spiking and silence. A similar analysis performed
                  for a half-center oscillator model outlined a much
                  larger area of bursting. Bursting in the half-center
                  oscillator model is also less sensitive to variation
                  in the maximal conductances of voltage-gated
                  currents than in the single-neuron model. Thus, in
                  addition to ensuring appropriate bursting
                  characteristics such as period, phase, and duty
                  cycles, the half-center configuration enhances
                  oscillation robustness, making them less susceptible
                  to random or imposed changes in membrane
                  parameters. Endogenous bursting, in turn, ensures
                  appropriate bursting if the strength of mutual
                  inhibition is weakened and limits the minimum period
                  of the half-center oscillator to a period near that
                  of the single neuron.},

                  antagonistic motor centres during swimming in the
                  paralysed Xenopus embryo has been investigated
                  further. Paired intracellular recordings have been
                  made from interneurones and motoneurones in an
                  attempt to identify neurones which make direct
                  inhibitory synapses onto motoneurones on the
                  opposite side of the spinal cord. A physiological
                  class of inhibitory interneurones is described
                  which, when stimulated by intracellular current
                  passage, evoke short-latency, probably monosynaptic,
                  strychnine-sensitive inhibitory potentials in
                  contralateral motoneurones. These inhibitory
                  interneurones fire once per swimming cycle in phase
                  with the ipsilateral motor root discharge. They
                  therefore have a pattern of activity which would
                  cause them to inhibit motoneurones of the
                  antagonistic motor centre at an appropriate part of
                  the swimming cycle. The intracellular injection of
                  horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has allowed the
                  morphology of these inhibitory interneurones to be
                  characterized. They have unipolar cell bodies with a
                  thick proximal process with short dendrites which
                  crosses the spinal cord ventrally and then
                  bifurcates with one axonal branch ascending into the
                  hind brain and the other descending the spinal
                  cord. These anatomical features are typical of the
                  'commissural interneurones' first described by
                  Roberts \& Clarke (1982). There are also some
                  inhibitory interneurones which can inhibit
                  motoneurones on the same side of the spinal cord. At
                  least some of these interneurones may be commissural
                  interneurones with ipsilateral axons and they may
                  play a role in the generation of the swimming
                  rhythm.},

                  dissociated and conventional patch clamp techniques
                  were used to record the whole-cell currents in the
                  presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). 2. The outward
                  currents of the acutely isolated spinal neurons were
                  rapidly reduced to about half their control value by
                  substitution of extracellular Na+ with
                  N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine or choline. 3. The use
                  of Li+ as a Na+ substitute partially reduced the
                  outward currents. 4. The reversal potential of the
                  Na(+)-sensitive current was close to the K+
                  equilibrium potential and could be altered by
                  changing extracellular K+. The Na(+)-sensitive
                  current was therefore a K+ current. 5. The
                  Na(+)-sensitive K+ current was voltage dependent and
                  activated in a sustained manner and appeared very
                  similar to the delayed rectifier present in these
                  neurons. 6. While the Na(+)-sensitive current
                  increased with voltage as might be expected for an
                  outward current, at very positive potentials it
                  progressively decreased in amplitude. The voltage
                  range over which this decrease was present moved
                  closer to zero as the levels of intracellular Na+
                  were increased. The tail currents evoked by positive
                  test potentials did not correspondingly decrease in
                  amplitude, suggesting that channel block was rapidly
                  relieved by stepping back to the holding
                  potential. 7. Intracellular perfusion of the patch
                  pipette with solutions containing varying amounts of
                  Na+ (0-20 mM) showed that the K+ currents could be
                  increased in a dose-dependent manner by raising
                  intracellular Na+. The current had an EC50 for Na+
                  of 7.3 mM and a Hill coefficient of 4.6. 8. Single
                  channel recordings from isolated inside-out patches
                  revealed a channel that gated more frequently when
                  the bathing levels of Na+ were elevated from 3 to 12
                  or 50 mM. Xenopus spinal cord neurons therefore
                  possess a current that is not only voltage dependent
                  but is also sensitive to internal Na+. 9. Xenopus
                  spinal neurons possess a transient Na+ current
                  (blocked by the inclusion of TTX) and a leak channel
                  permeable to Na+. The inward leakage of Na+ appeared
                  to provide the Na+ necessary for the gating of the
                  Na(+)-dependent channel. 10. Blocking the Na(+)-K+
                  exchange pumps by removing extracellular K+, reduced
                  the effect of removal of external Na+, suggesting
                  that the Na(+)-K+ exchange pumps could be important
                  in controlling the submembrane Na+.(ABSTRACT

                  grazing contact of a periodic trajectory in a hybrid
                  dynamical system under a common abstract framework
                  and establishes selected general properties of the
                  associated near-grazing dynamics. In particular, it
                  is shown that for critical choices of parameter
                  values, commonly used physical models of rigid or
                  compliant mechanical contact, capillary adhesion,
                  and cell division satisfy the conditions required by
                  the general framework. The paper relies on the
                  well-known discontinuity-mapping formalism. In
                  contrast to previous treatments, the proposed
                  abstract framework more clearly establishes the
                  origin of the large state-space stretching in the
                  initial (and possibly only) step of the construction
                  of a discontinuity mapping. It further highlights
                  the nonuniqueness in the formulation of the
                  discontinuity mapping and its connection to the
                  choice of a locally smooth map with which the
                  discontinuity mapping is composed to describe the
                  near-grazing dynamics. The analysis is illustrated
                  with examples from tapping-mode atomic force
                  microscopy in the presence of thin fluid layers on
                  the sample and the probe tip and from the study of

                  interacting groups of neurons drive a variety of
                  repetitive, rhythmic behaviors in invertebrates and
                  vertebrates, such as arise in locomotion,
                  respiration, mastication, scratching, and so
                  on. These CPGs are able to generate rhythmic
                  activity in the absence of afferent feedback or
                  rhythmic inputs. However, functionally relevant CPGs
                  must adaptively respond to changing demands,
                  manifested as changes in oscillation period or in
                  relative phase durations in response to variations
                  in non-patterned inputs or drives. Although many
                  half-center CPG models, composed of symmetric units
                  linked by reciprocal inhibition yet varying in their
                  intrinsic cellular properties, have been proposed,
                  the precise oscillatory mechanisms operating in most
                  biological CPGs remain unknown. Using numerical
                  simulations and phase-plane analysis, we
                  comparatively investigated how the intrinsic
                  cellular features incorporated in different CPG
                  models, such as subthreshold activation based on a
                  slowly inactivating persistent sodium current,
                  adaptation based on slowly activating
                  calcium-dependent potassium current, or
                  post-inhibitory rebound excitation, can contribute
                  to the control of oscillation period and phase
                  durations in response to changes in excitatory
                  external drive to one or both half-centers. Our
                  analysis shows that both the sensitivity of
                  oscillation period to alterations of excitatory
                  drive and the degree to which the duration of each
                  phase can be separately controlled depend strongly
                  on the intrinsic cellular mechanisms involved in
                  rhythm generation and phase transitions. In
                  particular, the CPG formed from units incorporating
                  a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current
                  shows the greatest range of oscillation periods and
                  the greatest degree of independence in phase
                  duration control by asymmetric inputs. These results
                  are explained based on geometric analysis of the
                  phase plane structures corresponding to the dynamics
                  for each CPG type, which in particular helps
                  pinpoint the roles of escape and release from
                  synaptic inhibition in the effects we find.},

                  of software for simulations of networks of spiking
                  neurons, with both negative and positive
                  consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses
                  its own programming or configuration language,
                  leading to considerable difficulty in porting models
                  from one simulator to another. This impedes
                  communication between investigators and makes it
                  harder to reproduce and build on the work of
                  others. On the other hand, simulation results can be
                  cross-checked between different simulators, giving
                  greater confidence in their correctness, and each
                  simulator has different optimizations, so the most
                  appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given
                  modelling task. A common programming interface to
                  multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the
                  problems of simulator diversity while retaining the
                  benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it
                  possible to write a simulation script once, using
                  the Python programming language, and run it without
                  modification on any supported simulator (currently
                  NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI
                  neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the
                  productivity of neuronal network modelling by
                  providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code
                  sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for
                  simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and
                  data-management tools. PyNN increases the
                  reliability of modelling studies by making it much
                  easier to check results on multiple simulators. PyNN
                  is open-source software and is available from

                  information that was just experienced or just
                  retrieved from long-term memory but no longer exists
                  in the external environment. These internal
                  representations are short-lived, but can be stored
                  for longer periods of time through active
                  maintenance or rehearsal strategies, and can be
                  subjected to various operations that manipulate the
                  information in such a way that makes it useful for
                  goal-directed behaviour. Empirical studies of
                  working memory using neuroscientific techniques,
                  such as neuronal recordings in monkeys or functional
                  neuroimaging in humans, have advanced our knowledge
                  of the underlying neural mechanisms of working
                  memory. This rich dataset can be reconciled with
                  behavioural findings derived from investigating the
                  cognitive mechanisms underlying working memory. In
                  this paper, I review the progress that has been made
                  towards this effort by illustrating how
                  investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying
                  working memory can be influenced by cognitive models
                  and, in turn, how cognitive models can be shaped and
                  modified by neuroscientific data. One conclusion
                  that arises from this research is that working
                  memory can be viewed as neither a unitary nor a
                  dedicated system. A network of brain regions,
                  including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is critical
                  for the active maintenance of internal
                  representations that are necessary for goal-directed
                  behaviour. Thus, working memory is not localized to
                  a single brain region but probably is an emergent
                  property of the functional interactions between the
                  PFC and the rest of the brain.},

  abstract     = {1. The oscillatory properties of the isolated
                  reticular (RE) thalamus were modeled with the use of
                  compartmental models of RE cells. Hodgkin-Huxley
                  type kinetic models of ionic channels were derived
                  from voltage- and current-clamp data from RE
                  cells. Interactions between interconnected RE cells
                  were simulated with the use of a kinetic model of
                  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory
                  synapses. 2. The intrinsic bursting properties of RE
                  cells in the model were due to the presence of a
                  low-threshold Ca2+ current and two Ca(2+)-activated
                  currents. The properties of these model RE cells
                  were compared with RE neurons recorded
                  intracellularly in vivo in cats. 3. Model RE cells
                  densely interconnected with GABAA synapses produced
                  synchronous oscillations at a frequency close to
                  that of spindles (7\textendash{}14 Hz). Networks of
                  RE neurons organized in a two-dimensional array with
                  only proximal connectivity also exhibited
                  synchronized oscillations in the spindle range. In
                  addition, the proximally connected network showed
                  periods of high and low synchronicity, giving rise
                  to waxing and waning oscillations in the population
                  of RE cells. 4. The spatiotemporal behavior of the
                  network was investigated during waxing and waning
                  oscillations. The waxing and waning emerged as an
                  alternation between periods of desynchronized and
                  synchronized activity, corresponding to periods of
                  irregular and coherent spatial activity. During
                  synchronized periods, the network displayed
                  propagating coherent waves of synchronous activity
                  that had a tendency to form spirals. 5. Networks of
                  model RE neurons fully connected through GABAB
                  synapses exhibited perfectly synchronous
                  oscillations at lower frequencies (0.5\textendash{}1
                  Hz), but two-dimensional networks with proximal
                  GABAB connectivity failed to synchronize. 6. These
                  simulations demonstrate that networks of model
                  neurons that include the main intrinsic currents
                  found in RE cells can generate waxing and waning
                  oscillatory activity similar to the spindle
                  rhythmicity observed in the isolated RE nucleus in
                  vivo. The model reveals the interplay between the
                  intrinsic rhythmic properties of RE cells and the
                  fast synaptic interactions in organizing
                  synchronized rhythmicity.},

                  network model of the pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex with
                  synaptic coupling. Using the methods of fast/slow
                  decomposition and two-parameter bifurcation
                  analysis, we divide the two-parameter space into
                  four different regions according to the multiphase
                  oscillations, and reveal the possible transition
                  mechanisms of bursting between these different
                  regions. We also study the dynamics of the system

  abstract     = {Previous numerical and analytical work has shown
                  that synaptic coupling can allow a network of model
                  neurons to synchronize despite heterogeneity in
                  intrinsic parameter values. In particular,
                  synchronous bursting oscillations can arise in a
                  network with excitatory synaptic coupling, even in
                  the absence of intrinsically bursting neurons. In
                  this work, we explore how the intrinsic dynamics of
                  neurons within a reduced three-cell network
                  influence its ability to exhibit synchronous
                  bursting and the frequency range over which such
                  activity can occur. We establish necessary and
                  sufficient conditions for the existence of
                  synchronous bursting solutions and perform related
                  numerical experiments in three-cell networks that
                  include a quiescent cell, a tonically active cell,
                  and a third added cell. Our results show that, in
                  most cases, the addition of a quiescent cell is
                  optimal for synchronous network bursting, in a
                  variety of ways, and that intrinsically bursting
                  cells can be detrimental to synchronous bursting,
                  and we explain the mechanisms underlying these
                  effects. These findings may help explain how robust
                  synchronous oscillations arise in neuronal central
                  pattern generators, such as the mammalian
                  inspiratory network, despite the presence of
                  significant cellular heterogeneity. They also
                  support the idea that intrinsic burst capabilities
                  of individual cells need not be central to these
                  networks' rhythms., Previous numerical and
                  analytical work has shown that synaptic coupling can
                  allow a network of model neurons to synchronize
                  despite heterogeneity in intrinsic parameter
                  values. In particular, synchronous bursting
                  oscillations can arise in a network with excitatory
                  synaptic coupling, even in the absence of
                  intrinsically bursting neurons. In this work, we
                  explore how the intrinsic dynamics of neurons within
                  a reduced three-cell network influence its ability
                  to exhibit synchronous bursting and the frequency
                  range over which such activity can occur. We
                  establish necessary and sufficient conditions for
                  the existence of synchronous bursting solutions and
                  perform related numerical experiments in three-cell
                  networks that include a quiescent cell, a tonically
                  active cell, and a third added cell. Our results
                  show that, in most cases, the addition of a

                  neurophysiological tool creates new possibilities to
                  understand complex systems and to test whether a
                  given model can explain experimental
                  findings. Simulations, however, require a detailed
                  specification of the model, including the nerve cell
                  action potential and synaptic transmission. We
                  describe a neuron model of intermediate complexity,
                  with a small number of compartments representing the
                  soma and the dendritic tree, and equipped with Na+,
                  K+, Ca2+, and Ca2+ dependent K+
                  channels. Conductance changes in the different
                  compartments are used to model conventional
                  excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
                  interactions. Voltage dependent NMDA-receptor
                  channels are also included, and influence both the
                  electrical conductance and the inflow of Ca2+
                  ions. This neuron model has been designed for the
                  analysis of neural networks and specifically for the
                  simulation of the network generating locomotion in a
                  simple vertebrate, the lamprey. By assigning
                  experimentally established properties to the

                  possible to verify the sufficiency of these
                  properties to account for a number of experimental
                  findings of the network in operation. The model is,

                  complicated behavior which may be pathological for
                  biological control systems. Nevertheless, strong
                  coupling may be needed to prevent asynchrony. We
                  discuss how some neural networks may be designed to
                  achieve only simple locking behavior when the
                  coupling is strong. The design is based on the fact
                  that the method of averaging produces equations that
                  are capable only of locking or drift, not
                  pathological complexity. Furthermore, it is shown
                  that oscillators that interact by means of multiple
                  pulses per cycle, dispersed around the cycle, behave
                  like averaged equations, even if the number of
                  pulses is small. We discuss the biological intuition
                  behind this scheme, and show numerically that it
                  works when the oscillators are taken to be
                  composites, each unit of which is governed by a
                  well-known model of a neural oscillator. Finally, we
                  describe numerical methods for computing from
                  equations for coupled limit cycle oscillators the
                  averaged coupling functions of our theory.},

  abstract     = {In most of the mammalian sensory systems there are
                  massive cortical feedback projections to early
                  processing stations. The mammalian accessory
                  olfactory system is considered unique in several
                  aspects. It is specialized for processing pheromonal
                  signals and plays a critical role in regulating
                  sociosexual behaviors. Furthermore, pheromonal
                  signals are believed to bypass cortex and reach the
                  hypothalamic behavioral centers after merely three
                  forward projections. Because the organization of the
                  feedback projections in the accessory olfactory
                  system remains largely unclear, the importance of
                  the feedback projections in the processing of
                  pheromonal signals has been ignored. Here we show
                  that in mice the feedback projections from the bed
                  nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) and the
                  vomeronasal amygdala to the accessory olfactory bulb
                  (AOB) are topographically organized and use
                  different neurotransmitters. By retrograde and
                  anterograde tracing, we find that the feedback
                  projection from the BST terminates in the AOB mitral
                  cell layer, whereas that from the amygdala
                  terminates in the AOB granule cell layer. By
                  combining tracing, genetic labeling of GABAergic
                  neurons, and immunostaining against a marker of
                  glutamatergic synapses, we observe that the
                  BST-to-AOB projection is GABAergic whereas the
                  amygdala-to-AOB projection is glutamatergic. In
                  addition, a substantial number of feedback neurons
                  in the amygdala and BST express estrogen
                  receptors. Thus, the accessory olfactory system,
                  like other sensory systems, possesses extensive
                  feedback projections. Moreover, our results suggest
                  that central hormonal cues may modulate the
                  processing of pheromonal signals at early stations
                  through the precisely organized feedback
                  projections.},

                  that are essential for the generation of population
                  rhythms in the mammalian brain is a challenging
                  problem. This problem cannot be addressed either by
                  experimental or computational studies in
                  isolation. Here we show that computational models
                  that are carefully linked with experiment provide
                  insight into this problem. Using the experimental
                  context of a whole hippocampus preparation in vitro
                  that spontaneously expresses theta frequency
                  (3\textendash{}12 Hz) population bursts in the CA1
                  region, we create excitatory network models to
                  examine whether cellular adaptation bursting
                  mechanisms could critically contribute to the
                  generation of this rhythm. We use biologically-based
                  cellular models of CA1 pyramidal cells and network
                  sizes and connectivities that correspond to the
                  experimental context. By expanding our mean field
                  analyses to networks with heterogeneity and non
                  all-to-all coupling, we allow closer correspondence
                  with experiment, and use these analyses to greatly
                  extend the range of parameter values that are
                  explored. We find that our model excitatory networks
                  can produce theta frequency population bursts in a
                  robust fashion.Thus, even though our networks are
                  limited by not including inhibition at present, our
                  results indicate that cellular adaptation in
                  pyramidal cells could be an important aspect for the
                  occurrence of theta frequency population bursting in
                  the hippocampus. These models serve as a starting
                  framework for the inclusion of inhibitory cells and
                  for the consideration of additional experimental
                  features not captured in our present network

  abstract     = {This study examines the ability of neurons to track
                  temporally varying inputs, namely by investigating
                  how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron is
                  modulated by a noisy input with a small sinusoidal
                  component with frequency (f). Using numerical
                  simulations of conductance-based neurons and
                  analytical calculations of one-variable nonlinear
                  integrate-and-fire neurons, we characterized the
                  dependence of this modulation on f. For sufficiently
                  high noise, the neuron acts as a low-pass
                  filter. The modulation amplitude is approximately
                  constant for frequencies up to a cutoff frequency,
                  fc, after which it decays. The cutoff frequency
                  increases almost linearly with the firing rate. For
                  higher frequencies, the modulation amplitude decays
                  as C/fŒ±, where the power Œ± depends on the spike
                  initiation mechanism. For conductance-based models,
                  Œ± = 1, and the prefactor C depends solely on the
                  average firing rate and a spike ‚Äúslope factor,‚Äù
                  which determines the sharpness of the spike
                  initiation. These results are attributable to the
                  fact that near threshold, the sodium activation
                  variable can be approximated by an exponential
                  function. Using this feature, we propose a
                  simplified one-variable model, the ‚Äúexponential
                  integrate-and-fire neuron,‚Äù as an approximation of a
                  conductance-based model. We show that this model
                  reproduces the dynamics of a simple
                  conductance-based model extremely well. Our study
                  shows how an intrinsic neuronal property (the
                  characteristics of fast sodium channels) determines
                  the speed with which neurons can track changes in
                  input.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the creation of the modern
                  geometrical theory of dynamical systems by
                  Poincar{\'e} at the end of the 19th century was
                  motivated by problems arising in celestial mechanics
                  [41]. Perhaps it is not so widely known that the
                  dynamics of electronic circuits played an important
                  role at the early stages of the development of this
                  theory. In the 1920s Van der Pol [47] described the
                  periodic oscillations of self-sustained circuits in
                  terms of the limit cycles of
                  Poincar{\'e}. Heperformed experiments
                  withperiodically excited circuits and measured, for
                  the first time, complex behavior in a nonlinear
                  system. In the 1930s there was pioneering work of
                  Andronov's Russian school on the theory of
                  oscillations in electronic, mechanical and control
                  systems [11]. It is important to realize that these
                  first applications of Poincar{\'e}'s qualitative
                  theory to electronic circuits led to new concepts
                  and theoretical results. Examples of this include
                  Li{\'e}nard's theorems [40, Chap. 3], as motivated
                  by the works of Van der Pol, the development of
                  bifurcation theory for planar systems by Andronov
                  and co-workers [9], and the introduction of the
                  concept of structural stability by Andronov and
                  Pontriaguin [10]. The relationship between the
                  mathematical theory of ordinary differential
                  equations (ODEs) and the dynamics of electronic
                  circuits was initially very close, but this did not
                  continue for very long. In fact, one might speak of
                  a divorce between the two fields in the subsequent
                  development, where electronic devices and systems
                  became ever more complex and of greater
                  dimension. Starting with the invention of the
                  transistor in the 1950s, there was a true explosion
                  in the size of electronic circuits, culminating in
                  the ascent of the microchip \textemdash{} a complex
                  circuit with thousands or even millions of
                  components. In theoretical investigations of such
                  electronic circuits one can hardly find a trace of
                  the geometrical theory of dynamical systems. One of
                  the few exceptions is the almost forgotten work of
                  Hayashi's school in Japan on the global dynamics in
                  experiments with analog computers [46].},

  abstract     = {This article describes a process theory based on
                  active inference and belief propagation. Starting
                  from the premise that all neuronal processing (and
                  action selection) can be explained by maximizing
                  Bayesian model evidence\textemdash{}or minimizing
                  variational free energy\textemdash{}we ask whether
                  neuronal responses can be described as a gradient
                  descent on variational free energy. Using a standard
                  (Markov decision process) generative model, we
                  derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this
                  description and reproduce a remarkable range of
                  well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include
                  repetition suppression, mismatch negativity,
                  violation responses, place-cell activity, phase
                  precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling,
                  evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and
                  transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the
                  (approximately Bayes' optimal) behavior prescribed
                  by these dynamics has a degree of face validity,
                  providing a formal explanation for reward seeking,
                  context learning, and epistemic
                  foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient
                  descent appears to be a valid description of
                  neuronal activity means that variational free energy
                  is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which
                  therefore conform to Hamilton's principle of least
                  action.},

                  the mammalian respiratory brainstem, represents an
                  ideal system for investigating the synchronization
                  properties of complex neuronal circuits via the
                  interaction of cell-type heterogeneity and network
                  connectivity. In isolation, individual respiratory
                  neurons from the pre-B{\"o}tC may be tonically
                  active, rhythmically bursting, or quiescent. Despite
                  this intrinsic heterogeneity, coupled networks of
                  pre-B{\"o}tC neurons en bloc engage in synchronized
                  bursting that can drive inspiratory motor neuron
                  activation. The region's connection topology has
                  been recently characterized and features dense
                  clusters of cells with occasional connections
                  between clusters. We investigate how the dynamics of
                  individual neurons (quiescent/bursting/tonic) and
                  the betweenness centrality of neurons' positions
                  within the network connectivity graph interact to
                  govern network burst synchrony, by simulating
                  heterogeneous networks of computational model
                  pre-B{\"o}tC neurons. Furthermore, we compare the
                  prevalence and synchrony of bursting across networks
                  constructed with a variety of connection topologies,
                  analyzing the same collection of heterogeneous
                  neurons in small-world, scale-free, random, and
                  regularly structured networks. We find that several
                  measures of network burst synchronization are
                  determined by interactions of network topology with
                  the intrinsic dynamics of neurons at central network
                  positions and by the strengths of synaptic
                  connections between neurons. Surprisingly, despite
                  the functional role of synchronized bursting within
                  the pre-B{\"o}tC, we find that synchronized network
                  bursting is generally weakest when we use its
                  specific connection topology, which leads to
                  synchrony within clusters but poor coordination
                  across clusters. Overall, our results highlight the
                  relevance of interactions between topology and
                  intrinsic dynamics in shaping the activity of
                  networks and the concerted effects of connectivity

  abstract     = {The idea of everything returning eventually to its
                  point of departure has a strong hold on humanity,
                  with many historical, philosophical and religious
                  implications. Classical examples are the need to
                  construct a calendar and the subsequent search for
                  orbits in the solar system in which the planets
                  follow a closed track and repeat their history over
                  and over again. Nature, at its most basic level, has
                  decided to be Hamiltonian; non- Hamiltonian systems
                  come up in physics only as phenomenological models
                  for the more complicated underlying
                  processes. However, Hamiltonian systems are
                  nongeneric dynamical systems with remarkable
                  properties, in particular with respect to periodic
                  orbits. The role of periodic solutions in
                  Hamiltonian systems and their importance in modern
                  physics was first recognized by Poincar{\'e}
                  [26]. Today periodic orbits are at the basis of both
                  classical and quantum mechanics [13]. Poincar{\'e}
                  conjectured that periodic orbits, that is, solutions
                  that return to their initial conditions after some
                  finite time, are densely distributed among all
                  possible bounded classical trajectories; and he
                  suggested that the study of periodic orbits would
                  provide the clue to the overall behavior of any
                  mechanical system. Quoting the original work [26]:
                  ``It seems at first that the existence of periodic
                  solutions could not be of any practical interest
                  whatsoever. Indeed, the probability is zero for the
                  initial condition to correspond precisely to those
                  of a periodic solution. But it may happen that they
                  differ by very little. [\ldots] Here is a fact which
                  I have not been able to demonstrate rigorously, but
                  which nevertheless seems very plausible to me. Given
                  equations of the Hamiltonian form and any particular
                  solution of these equations, we can always find a
                  periodic solution (whose period may admittedly be
                  very long) such that the difference between the two
                  solutions is as small as we wish during as long a
                  time as we wish. Besides this, what renders these
                  periodic solutions so precious is that they are, so
                  to speak, the only opening through which we may try
                  to penetrate into the fortress which has the
                  reputation of being impregnable.''},

                  spatially homogeneous network of spiking
                  neurons. Under standard conditions, a necessary and,
                  in the limit of a large number of interacting

                  in studies of responses to any sensory
                  stimulus. Consequently, burst detection appears to
                  be a critical problem for which the Poisson-surprise
                  (PS) method has been widely used for 20
                  years. However, this method has faced some recurrent
                  criticism about the underlying assumptions regarding
                  the interspike interval (ISI) distributions. In this
                  paper, we avoid such assumptions by using a
                  nonparametric approach for burst detection based on
                  the ranks of ISI in the entire spike train. Similar
                  to the PS statistic, a ``Rank surprise'' (RS)
                  statistic is extracted. A new algorithm performing
                  an exhaustive search of bursts in the spike trains
                  is also presented. Compared to the performances of
                  the PS method on realizations of gamma renewal
                  processes and spike trains recorded in cat auditory
                  cortex, we show that the RS method is very robust
                  for any type of ISI distribution and is based on an
                  elementary formalization of the definition of a
                  burst. It presents an alternative to the PS method
                  for non-Poisson spike trains and is simple to

                  study the poorly understood mechanisms underlying
                  vertebrate motor pattern switching. Here, we present
                  a combined kinematic and electrophysiological
                  description of the changes that occur during a
                  switch between two rhythmic behaviours: struggling
                  and swimming. Stable struggling movements evoked by
                  sensory stimulation were followed by a transitionary
                  period of variable duration leading to
                  swimming. During the transition, cycle period and
                  bending strength (local bending angle) progressively
                  decreased and longitudinal delay progressively
                  reversed. These changes were paralleled by similar
                  changes in cycle period, burst duration and
                  longitudinal delay of the motor pattern in
                  immobilised embryos. The three movement parameters
                  and their motor pattern correlates all scaled
                  together during struggling and transitionary
                  patterns. Our results indicate that transitions can
                  be gradual (consistent with an earlier conclusion
                  that a single set of pattern generating circuitry is
                  involved); that the transitional movements are
                  centrally programmed; and that they form a continuum
                  with struggling movements. The correlated change of
                  motor pattern parameters suggests that either a
                  single mechanism underlies the components of the
                  switch from struggling to swimming, or that separate
                  mechanisms are closely linked.},

                  2316\textendash{}2328, 1998. We have investigated
                  the effects of ascending inhibitory pathways on two
                  centrally generated rhythmic motor patterns in a
                  simple vertebrate model, the young Xenopus
                  tadpole. Tadpoles swim when touched, but when
                  grasped respond with slower, stronger struggling
                  movements during which the longitudinal pattern of
                  motor activity is reversed. Surgical spinal cord
                  transection to remove all ascending connections
                  originating caudal to the transection (in tadpoles
                  immobilized in $\alpha$-bungarotoxin) did not affect
                  ``fictive'' swimming generated more rostrally. In
                  contrast, cycle period and burst duration both
                  significantly increased during fictive
                  struggling. Increases were progressively larger with
                  more rostral transection. Blocking caudal activity
                  with the anesthetic MS222 (pharmacological
                  transection) produced equivalent but reversible
                  effects. Reducing crossed-ascending inhibition
                  selectively, either by midsagittal spinal cord
                  division or rostral cord hemisection (1-sided
                  transection) mimicked the effects of
                  transection. Like transection, both operations
                  increased cycle period and burst duration during
                  struggling but did not affect swimming. The changes
                  during struggling were larger with more rostral
                  hemisection. Reducing crossed-ascending inhibition
                  by spinal hemisection also increased the
                  rostrocaudal longitudinal delay during swimming, and
                  the caudorostral delay during struggling. Weakening
                  inhibition globally with low concentrations of the
                  glycine antagonist strychnine (10\textendash{}100
                  nM) did not alter swimming cycle period, burst
                  duration, or longitudinal delay. However, strychnine
                  at 10\textendash{}60 nM decreased cycle period
                  during struggling. It also increased burst duration
                  in some cases, although burst duration increased as
                  a proportion of cycle period in all
                  cases. Strychnine reduced longitudinal delay during
                  struggling, making rostral and caudal activity more
                  synchronous. At 100 nM, struggling was totally
                  disrupted. By combining our results with a detailed
                  knowledge of tadpole spinal cord anatomy, we
                  conclude that inhibition mediated by the
                  crossed-ascending axons of characterized,
                  glycinergic, commissural interneurons has a major
                  influence on the struggling motor pattern compared
                  with swimming. We suggest that this difference is a
                  consequence of the larger, reversed longitudinal
                  delay and the extended burst duration during
                  struggling compared with swimming.},

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: General intelligence is important for
                  success in daily life, fueling interest in
                  developing cognitive training as an intervention to
                  improve fluid ability (Gf). A major obstacle to the
                  design of effective cognitive interventions has been
                  the paucity of hypotheses bearing on mechanisms
                  underlying transfer of cognitive training to
                  Gf. Despite the large amounts of money and time
                  currently being expended on cognitive training,
                  there is little scientific agreement on how, or even
                  whether, Gf can be heightened by such training.
                  METHOD: We review the relevant strands of evidence
                  on cognitive-training-related changes in (a)
                  cortical mechanisms of distraction suppression, and
                  (b) activation of the dorsal attention network
                  (DAN). We hypothesize that training-related
                  increases in control of attention are important for
                  what is termed far transfer of cognitive training to
                  untrained abilities, notably to Gf.  RESULTS: We
                  review the evidence that distraction suppression
                  evident in behavior, neuronal firing, scalp
                  electroencephalography, and hemodynamic change is
                  important for protecting target processing during
                  perception and also for protecting targets held in
                  working memory. Importantly, attentional control
                  also appears to be central to performance on Gf
                  assessments. Consistent with this evidence, forms of
                  cognitive training that increase ability to ignore
                  distractions (e.g., working memory training and
                  perceptual training) not only affect the DAN but
                  also affect transfer to Gf.  CONCLUSIONS: Our
                  hypothesis is supported by existing
                  evidence. However, to advance the field of cognitive
                  training, it is necessary that competing hypotheses
                  on mechanisms of far transfer of cognitive training
                  be advanced and empirically tested. (PsycINFO

                  in the in vitro preparation of the lamprey spinal
                  cord. The ionic basis of these oscillations were
                  investigated in the presence of
                  N-methyl-d,l-aspartate and TTX. Addition of blocking
                  agents (2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and
                  tetraethylammonium (TEA)) and selective removal or
                  substitution of certain ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, Ba2+)
                  were used in the analysis of the oscillations. The
                  depolarizing phase of the oscillation requires Na+
                  ions but not Ca2+ ions. The depolarization becomes
                  larger if TEA is administered in the bath, which
                  presumably is due to a blockade of potassium (K+)
                  channels activated during the depolarizing
                  phase. The repolarization appears to depend on a
                  Ca2+ entry, which presumably acts indirectly by an
                  activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. Together
                  with the NMDA-induced voltage dependence, this will
                  bring the membrane potential back down to a

                  doctrine, defining the neuron as the fundamental
                  signaling unit of the nervous system. Over a century
                  later, neurobiologists address the circuit doctrine:
                  the logic of the core units of neuronal circuitry
                  that control animal behavior. These are circuits
                  that can be called into action for perceptual,
                  conceptual, and motor tasks, and we now need to
                  understand whether there are coherent and overriding
                  principles that govern the design and function of
                  these modules. The discovery of central motor

  abstract     = {Many neural systems display adaptive properties that
                  occur on timescales that are slower than the time
                  scales associated withrepetitive firing of action
                  potentials or bursting oscillations. Spike frequency
                  adaptation is the name givento processes thatreduce
                  the frequency of rhythmic tonic firing of action
                  potentials,sometimes leading to the termination of
                  spiking and the cell becomingquiescent. This article
                  examines these processes mathematically,within the
                  context of singularly perturbed dynamical systems.We
                  place emphasis on the lengths of successive
                  interspikeintervals during adaptation. Two different
                  bifurcation mechanisms insingularly perturbed
                  systems that correspond to the termination offiring
                  are distinguished by the rate at which interspike
                  intervalsslow near the termination of firing. We
                  compare theoreticalpredictions to measurement of
                  spike frequency adaptation in a modelof the LP cell

                  many different cognitive tasks in functional imaging
                  studies, including the posterior cingulate cortex
                  (PCC) and a medial frontal region incorporating
                  portions of the medial frontal gyrus and ventral
                  anterior cingulate cortex (MFG/vACC). It has been
                  suggested that these areas are components in a
                  default mode network that is engaged during rest and
                  disengaged during cognitive tasks. This study
                  investigated the functional connectivity between the
                  PCC and MFG/vACC during a working memory task and at
                  rest by examining temporal correlations in magnetic
                  resonance signal levels between the regions. The two
                  regions were functionally connected in both
                  conditions. In addition, performance on the working
                  memory task was positively correlated with the
                  strength of this functional connection not only
                  during the working memory task, but also at
                  rest. Thus, it appears these regions are components
                  of a network that may facilitate or monitor
                  cognitive performance, rather than becoming
                  disengaged during cognitive tasks. In addition,
                  these data raise the possibility that the individual
                  differences in coupling strength between these two
                  regions at rest predict differences in cognitive

  abstract     = {In computational and pure mathematics it is
                  necessary to choose a representation or notation for
                  the object being computed or manipulated. The
                  parallel between notation and computational
                  representation is quite close, although the computer
                  is able to deal with expressions that are far too
                  complicated to be dealt with by hand. A good
                  notation makes manipulations easier and reduces
                  errors, and a good computational representation
                  makes operations easier to implement, thus reducing
                  coding errors. The choice of representation is often
                  not made explicitly, especially when the objects are
                  simple. The choice of representation also serves to
                  distinguish between algorithms. Indeed, once the
                  choice of a representation is made there are often
                  fewer choices of how to proceed. We use this
                  approach in Sect. 3.2 to analyze five algorithms for
                  higher-dimensional continuation that are in the
                  literature. For one-dimensional continuation many
                  issues are quite straightforward, since curves are
                  easily represented as lists of points. However,
                  representing surfaces and manifolds is more
                  challenging. In Sect. 3.1.1 we discuss simplicial
                  and cell complexes, which are general meshes that
                  are commonly used in algebraic topology. Then we
                  define manifolds and manifolds with boundary, which
                  are the analogues of curves and arcs in one
                  dimension. Section 3.1.2 describes two fundamental
                  geometric abstractions, the Voronoi and Delaunay
                  tessellations, and a particular generalization of
                  the Voronoi tessellation that represents the
                  boundary of a union of spherical balls. In
                  Sect. 3.1.3 we discuss how these topological and
                  geometrical ideas have been used to represent
                  manifolds and, finally, how to construct the
                  neighborhood of a regular point.},

                  network that paces the heartbeat of the leech. This
                  model represents a network of six heart interneurons
                  that comprise the basic rhythm-generating network
                  within a single ganglion. This model builds on a
                  previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by
                  incorporating modifications of intrinsic and
                  synaptic currents based on the results of a
                  realistic waveform voltage-clamp study (Olsen and
                  Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications, the
                  new model behaves more similarly to the biological
                  system than the previous model. For example, the
                  slow-wave oscillation of membrane potential that
                  underlies bursting is similar in form and amplitude
                  to that of the biological system. Furthermore, the
                  new model with its expanded architecture
                  demonstrates how coordinating interneurons
                  contribute to the oscillations within a single

                  with the existence of abnormal oscillations within
                  the basal ganglia with frequencies in the beta band
                  (13-30 Hz). While the origin of these oscillations
                  remains unknown, there is some evidence suggesting
                  that oscillations observed in the basal ganglia
                  arise due to interactions of two nuclei: the
                  subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus
                  pars externa (GPe). To investigate this hypothesis,
                  we develop a computational model of the STN-GPe
                  network based upon anatomical and
                  electrophysiological studies. Significantly, our
                  study shows that for certain parameter regimes, the
                  model intrinsically oscillates in the beta
                  range. Through an analytical study of the model, we
                  identify a simple set of necessary conditions on
                  model parameters that guarantees the existence of
                  beta oscillations. These conditions for generation
                  of oscillations are described by a set of simple
                  inequalities and can be summarized as follows: (1)
                  The excitatory connections from STN to GPe and the
                  inhibitory connections from GPe to STN need to be
                  sufficiently strong. (2) The time required by
                  neurons to react to their inputs needs to be short
                  relative to synaptic transmission delays. (3) The
                  excitatory input from the cortex to STN needs to be
                  high relative to the inhibition from striatum to

                  estimates for neuron properties, population sizes,
                  synapsestrengths and connections, we show that:
                  long-lasting, mutual, glutamatergic

                  sustain rhythmic pacemaker firing atswimming

                  activity persists but rhythmbreaks down without

                  the rangeof synaptic feedback strengths generating
                  sustained rhythm. The network can beswitched on and

                  self-sustained activity following briefsynaptic
                  excitation. The frequency of activity is limited by
                  the kinetics of the neuronmembrane channels and can

                  activity canbe rhythmic at lower frequencies if the

                  that excitatory synaptic feedback can operate to

                  lamprey consists of a core network of glutamatergic
                  and glycinergic interneurons, previously studied
                  experimentally and through mathematical modeling. We
                  present a new and more detailed computational model
                  of lamprey locomotor network neurons, based
                  primarily on detailed electrophysiological
                  measurements and incorporating new experimental
                  findings. The model uses a
                  Hodgkin\textendash{}Huxley-like formalism and
                  consists of 86 membrane compartments containing 12
                  types of ion currents. One of the goals was to
                  introduce a fast, transient potassium current (Kt)
                  and two sodium-dependent potassium currents, one
                  faster (KNaF) and one slower (KNaS), in the
                  model. Not only has the model lent support to the
                  interpretation of experimental results but it has
                  also provided predictions for further experimental
                  analysis of single-network neurons. For example, Kt
                  was shown to be one critical factor for controlling
                  action potential duration. In addition, the model
                  has proved helpful in investigating the possible
                  influence of the slow afterhyperpolarization on
                  repetitive firing during ongoing activation. In
                  particular, the balance between the simulated slow
                  sodium-dependent and calcium-dependent potassium
                  currents has been explored, as well as the possible
                  involvement of dendritic conductances.},

                  responsible for locomotion. In many organisms,
                  activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
                  leads to generation of rhythmic locomotor
                  patterns. In addition, single neurons can display
                  intrinsic, NMDA-dependent membrane potential
                  oscillations when pharmacologically isolated from
                  each other by tetrodotoxin (TTX) application. Such
                  NMDA\textendash{}TTX oscillations have been
                  characterized, for instance, in lamprey locomotor
                  network neurons. Conceptual and computational models
                  have been put forward to explain the appearance and
                  characteristics of these oscillations. Here, we seek
                  to refine the understanding of NMDA\textendash{}TTX
                  oscillations by combining new experimental evidence
                  with computational modelling. We find that, in
                  contrast to previous computational predictions, the
                  oscillation frequency tends to increase when the
                  NMDA concentration is increased. We develop a new,
                  minimal computational model which can incorporate
                  this new information. This model is further
                  constrained by another new piece of experimental
                  evidence: that regular-looking NMDA\textendash{}TTX
                  oscillations can be obtained even after
                  voltage-dependent potassium and
                  high-voltage-activated calcium channels have been
                  pharmacologically blocked. Our model conforms to
                  several experimentally derived criteria that we have
                  set up and is robust to parameter changes, as
                  evaluated through sensitivity analysis. We use the
                  model to re-analyze an old NMDA\textendash{}TTX
                  oscillation model, and suggest an explanation of why
                  it failed to reproduce the new experimental data

                  different brain rhythms has sparked growing interest
                  in the oscillatory behaviours of neurons. Recent
                  research has uncovered a close association between
                  electrical oscillations and resonance in
                  neurons. Resonance is an easily measurable property
                  that describes the ability of neurons to respond
                  selectively to inputs at preferred frequencies. A
                  variety of ionic mechanisms support resonance and
                  oscillation in neurons. Understanding the basic
                  principles involved in the production of resonance
                  allows for a simplified classification of these
                  mechanisms. The characterization of resonance and
                  frequency preference captures those essential
                  properties of neurons that can serve as a substrate
                  for coordinating network activity around a

  abstract     = {The abilities of neuronal populations to encode
                  rapidly varying stimuli and respond quickly to
                  abrupt input changes are crucial for basic neuronal
                  computations, such as coincidence detection,
                  grouping by synchrony, and spike-timing-dependent
                  plasticity, as well as for the pro- cessing speed of
                  neuronal networks. Theoretical analyses have linked
                  these abilities to the fast-onset dynamics of action
                  potentials (APs). Using a combination of whole-cell
                  recordings from rat neocortical neurons and computer
                  simulations, we provide the first experimental
                  evidence for this conjecture and prove its validity
                  for the case of distal AP initiation in the axon
                  initial segment (AIS), typical for cortical
                  neurons. Neocortical neurons with fast-onset APs in
                  the soma can phase-lock their population firing to
                  signal frequencies up to
                  $\dottedsquare\dottedsquare$300 \textendash{} 400 Hz
                  and respond within 1\textendash{}2 ms to subtle
                  changes of input current. The ability to encode high
                  frequencies and response speed were dramatically
                  reduced when AP onset was slowed by experimental
                  manipulations or was intrinsically slow due to
                  immature AP generation mechanisms. Multicompartment
                  conductance- based models reproducing the initiation
                  of spikes in the AIS could encode high frequencies
                  only if AP onset was fast at the initiation site
                  (e.g., attributable to cooperative gating of a
                  fraction of sodium channels) but not when fast onset
                  of somatic AP was produced solely by backpropa-
                  gation. We conclude that fast-onset dynamics is a
                  genuine property of cortical AP generators. It
                  enables fast computations in cortical circuits that
                  are rich in recurrent connections both within each
                  region and across the hierarchy of areas.},

  abstract     = {Relationships between mental activity and EEG were
                  studied by the method of multivariate statistical
                  analysis. All 15 different kinds of subtests were
                  given by a 2 min time-limit method to 60 male
                  juvenile delinquents. To convert the EEG into
                  numerical form, frequency analysis of the EEG (Fz-Cz
                  lead) was carried out during performance of the
                  subsets, and amplitude of the integrated values of 5
                  frequency bands ($\delta$-, \texttheta-, $\alpha$-,
                  $\beta$1-, $\beta$2-band) was recorded for every 5
                  sec. 1. 1. The \texttheta{} activity during mental
                  performance seemed to originate in the frontal
                  midline area and tended to appear in the subtests
                  that required continous concentration of
                  attention. 2. 2. As the result of factor analysis of
                  the subtests' scores, four significant factors were
                  extracted: they could be named ability of simple
                  arithmetic and mechanical memory (factor 1), complex
                  arithmetic and rule identification ability (factor
                  2), ability of discrimination and induction (factor
                  3), perceptual ability of simple visual patterns
                  (factor 4). 3. 3. Factor analysis of the EEG band
                  scores proved that each $\sigma$-, $\alpha$-,
                  $\beta$1- and $\beta$2-band component of EEG was of
                  one-factor structure, all the correlation
                  coefficients being approximately +0.9 at
                  each. 4. 4. As the result of factor analysis at the
                  \texttheta-band scores of EEG, two significant
                  factors were extracted. They were interpreted
                  concerning to thinking (factor 1) and work speed
                  (factor 2).},

                  and CPG-like motor networks is still not fully
                  understood. The main unsolved questions are (i) What
                  are the respective roles of intrinsic bursting and
                  network based dynamics in systems of coupled
                  heterogeneous, intrinsically complex, even chaotic,
                  neurons? (ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the
                  coexistence of robustness and flexibility in the
                  observed rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns? One
                  common view is that particular bursting neurons
                  provide the rhythmogenic component while the
                  connections between different neurons are
                  responsible for the regularisation and
                  synchronisation of groups of neurons and for
                  specific phase relationships in multi-phasic
                  patterns. We have examined the spatio-temporal
                  rhythmic patterns in computer-simulated motif
                  networks of H\textendash{}H neurons connected by
                  slow inhibitory synapses with a non-symmetric
                  pattern of coupling strengths. We demonstrate that
                  the interplay between intrinsic and network dynamics
                  features either cooperation or competition,
                  depending on three basic control parameters
                  identified in our model: the shape of intrinsic
                  bursts, the strength of the coupling and its degree
                  of asymmetry. The cooperation of intrinsic dynamics
                  and network mechanisms is shown to correlate with
                  bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two different
                  attractors in the phase space of the system
                  corresponding to different rhythmic spatio-temporal
                  patterns. Conversely, if the network mechanism of
                  rhythmogenesis dominates, monostability is observed
                  with a typical pattern of winnerless competition
                  between neurons. We analyse bifurcations between the
                  two regimes and demonstrate how they provide
                  robustness and flexibility to the network
                  performance.},

                  here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines
                  the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For
                  example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node
                  bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes
                  with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a
                  well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an
                  integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of
                  incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast,
                  when the rest state is near an
                  Andronov\textendash{}Hopf bifurcation, the cell
                  fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are
                  not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined
                  threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an

                  i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain
                  (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the
                  input frequency may actually delay or terminate its
                  firing. We also describe the phenomenon of neural
                  bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to
                  extend the existing classification of bursters,
                  including many new types. We discuss how the type of
                  burster defines its neuro-computational properties,
                  and we show that different bursters can interact,

                  transition between a quiescent state and repetitive
                  spiking. When the transition to repetitive spiking
                  occurs via a subcritical Andronov--Hopf bifurcation
                  and the transition to the quiescent state occurs via
                  fold limit cycle bifurcation, the burster is said to
                  be of elliptic type (also known as a "subHopf/fold
                  cycle" burster). Here we study the synchronization
                  dynamics of weakly connected networks of such
                  bursters. We find that the behavior of such networks
                  is quite different from the behavior of weakly
                  connected phase oscillators and resembles that of
                  strongly connected relaxation oscillators. As a
                  result, such weakly connected bursters need few
                  (usually one) bursts to synchronize, and
                  synchronization is possible for bursters having
                  quite different quantitative features. We also find
                  that interactions between bursters depend crucially
                  on the spiking frequencies. Namely, the interactions
                  are most effective when the presynaptic interspike
                  frequency matches the frequency of postsynaptic
                  oscillations. Finally, we use the FitzHugh--Rinzel,
                  Morris--Lecar, and Hodgkin--Huxley models to
                  illustrate our major results.},

  abstract     = {What is the functional significance of generating a
                  burst of spikes, as opposed to a single spike? A
                  dominant point of view is that bursts are needed to
                  increase the reliability of communication between
                  neurons. Here, we discuss the alternative, but
                  complementary, hypothesis: bursts with specific
                  resonant interspike frequencies are more likely to
                  cause a postsynaptic cell to fire than are bursts
                  with higher or lower frequencies. Such a frequency
                  preference might occur at the level of individual
                  synapses because of the interplay between short-term
                  synaptic depression and facilitation, or at the
                  postsynaptic cell level because of subthreshold
                  membrane potential oscillations and resonance. As a
                  result, the same burst could resonate for some
                  synapses or cells and not resonate for others,
                  depending on their natural resonance
                  frequencies. This observation suggests that, in
                  addition to increasing reliability of synaptic
                  transmission, bursts of action potentials might
                  provide effective mechanisms for selective

                  analysis to document characteristic bifurcation
                  cascades of limit cycles in piecewise-smooth,
                  hybrid-dynamical-system models of the eukaryotic
                  cell cycle, and associated period-adding cascades in
                  piecewise-defined maps with gaps. A general theory
                  is formulated for the occurrence of such cascades,
                  for example given the existence of a period-two
                  orbit with one point on the system discontinuity and
                  with appropriate constraints on the forward
                  trajectory for nearby initial conditions. In this

  abstract     = {To study the role of brain oscillations in working
                  memory, we recorded the scalp electroencephalogram
                  (EEG) during the retention interval of a modified
                  Sternberg task. A power spectral analysis of the EEG
                  during the retention interval revealed a clear peak
                  at 9\textendash{}12 Hz, a frequency in the alpha
                  band (8\textendash{}13 Hz). In apparent conflict
                  with previous ideas according to which alpha band
                  oscillations represent brain `idling', we found that
                  the alpha peak systematically increased with the
                  number of items held in working memory. The
                  enhancement was prominent over the posterior and
                  bilateral central regions. The enhancement over
                  posterior regions is most likely explained by the
                  well known alpha rhythm produced close to the
                  parietal-occipital fissure, whereas the lateral
                  enhancement could be explained by sources in
                  somato-motor cortex. A time-frequency analysis
                  revealed that the enhancement was present throughout
                  the last 2.5 s of the 2.8 s retention interval and
                  that alpha power rapidly diminished following the
                  probe. The load dependence and the tight temporal
                  regulation of alpha provide strong evidence that the
                  alpha generating system is directly or indirectly
                  linked to the circuits responsible for working
                  memory. Although a clear peak in the theta band
                  (5\textendash{}8 Hz) was only detectable in one
                  subject, other lines of evidence indicate that theta
                  occurs and also has a role in working
                  memory. Hypotheses concerning the role of alpha band
                  activity in working memory are discussed.},

                  we recorded neuromagnetic responses from 10 subjects
                  performing the Sternberg task. Subjects were
                  required to retain a list of 1, 3, 5 or 7 visually

                  period. During the retention period we observed
                  ongoing frontal theta activity in the

                  frontal brain areas. The activity in the theta band

                  bifurcation processes related to period-doubling
                  bifurcation cascades to chaos observed in the
                  spontaneous firing patterns recorded from an injured
                  site of rat sciatic nerve as a
                  pacemaker. Period-doubling bifurcation cascades to
                  period-4 ($\pi$(2,2)) firstly, and then to chaos, at
                  last to a periodicity, which can be period-5,
                  period-4 ($\pi$(4)) and period-3, respectively, in
                  different pacemakers. The three bifurcation
                  processes are labeled as case I, II and III,
                  respectively, manifesting procedures different to
                  those of period-adding
                  bifurcation. Higher-dimensional unstable periodic
                  orbits (UPOs) can be detected in the chaos, built
                  close relationships to the periodic firing
                  patterns. Case III bifurcation process is similar to
                  that discovered in the Onchidium pacemaker neurons
                  and simulated in theoretical model-Chay model. The
                  extra-large Feigenbaum constant manifesting in the
                  period-doubling bifurcation process, induced by
                  quasi-discontinuous characteristics exhibited in the
                  first return maps of both ISI series and slow
                  variable of Chay model, shows that
                  higher-dimensional periodic behaviors appeared
                  difficult within the period-doubling bifurcation
                  cascades. The results not only provide examples of

                  burst and oscillatory patterns of neuronal
                  activity. In them, a burst period is defined as an
                  interval in which there are a significantly higher
                  number of spikes as compared to other intervals in
                  the spike train. Oscillation is defined as a spike
                  train in which significant periodicity is detected
                  in its autocorrelogram. The main feature of our
                  burst detection method is that discharge density
                  (i.e., the number of spikes in a short interval) is
                  used instead of the interspike interval. This
                  enables one to assess the likelihood of having burst

                  of periodicity detected and enables the detection of

                  functions such as a storage buffer and central
                  executive functions, but also coordination among
                  these functions. Neuroimaging studies have revealed
                  the contributions of different brain regions to
                  different functional roles in WM tasks; however,
                  little is known about the neural mechanism governing
                  their coordination. Electroencephalographic (EEG)
                  rhythms, especially theta and alpha, are known to
                  appear over distributed brain regions during WM
                  tasks, but the rhythms associated with task-relevant
                  regional coupling have not been obtained thus
                  far. In this study, we conducted
                  time\textendash{}frequency analyses for EEG data in
                  WM tasks that include manipulation periods and
                  memory storage buffer periods. We used both auditory
                  WM tasks and visual WM tasks. The results
                  successfully demonstrated function-specific EEG
                  activities. The frontal theta amplitudes increased
                  during the manipulation periods of both tasks. The
                  alpha amplitudes increased during not only the
                  manipulation but also the maintenance periods in the
                  temporal area for the auditory WM and the parietal
                  area for the visual WM. The phase synchronization
                  analyses indicated that, under the relevant task
                  conditions, the temporal and parietal regions show
                  enhanced phase synchronization in the theta bands
                  with the frontal region, whereas phase
                  synchronization between theta and alpha is
                  significantly enhanced only within the individual
                  areas. Our results suggest that WM task-relevant
                  brain regions are coordinated by distant theta
                  synchronization for central executive functions, by
                  local alpha synchronization for the memory storage
                  buffer, and by theta\textendash{}alpha coupling for
                  inter-functional integration.},

                  however, although one observes evolution at a

                  self-sustained oscillations between an Up state and
                  a Down state, in which a spatially localized

                  small-world connectivity on emergence of
                  noise-induced population synchronization. Thus,
                  noise-induced burst synchronization (synchrony on
                  the slow bursting time scale) and spike
                  synchronization (synchrony on the fast spike time
                  scale) are found to appear in a synchronized region
                  of the JJJ\textendash{}DDD plane (JJJ: synaptic
                  inhibition strength and DDD: noise intensity). As
                  the rewiring probability ppp is decreased from 1
                  (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region
                  of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the
                  JJJ\textendash{}DDD plane, while the region of the
                  burst synchronization decreases slowly. We separate
                  the slow bursting and the fast spiking time scales
                  via frequency filtering, and characterize the
                  noise-induced burst and spike synchronizations by
                  employing realistic order parameters and
                  statistical-mechanical measures introduced in our

                  and spiking order parameters,
                  respectively. Furthermore, we also measure the
                  degrees of burst and spike synchronizations in terms
                  of the statistical-mechanical bursting and spiking

                  synchronization transitions of bursting neurons in
                  the frequency domain. Instantaneous population
                  firing rate (IPFR) R(t)R(t)R(t), which is directly
                  obtained from the raster plot of neural spikes, is
                  often used as a realistic collective quantity
                  describing population activities in both the
                  computational and the experimental neuroscience. For
                  the case of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain
                  order parameter, based on R(t)R(t)R(t), was
                  introduced in our recent work to characterize the
                  spike synchronization transition. Unlike the case of
                  spiking neurons, the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) of bursting
                  neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the
                  slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales. For
                  our aim, we decompose the IPFR R(t)R(t)R(t) into the
                  instantaneous population bursting rate
                  Rb(t)Rb(t)R\_b(t) (describing the bursting behavior)
                  and the instantaneous population spike rate
                  Rs(t)Rs(t)R\_s(t) (describing the spiking behavior)
                  via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic
                  order parameter to the case of bursting
                  neurons. Thus, we develop the frequency-domain
                  bursting and spiking order parameters which are just
                  the bursting and spiking ``coherence factors''
                  $\beta$b$\beta$b$\backslash$beta \_b and
                  $\beta$s$\beta$s$\backslash$beta \_s of the bursting
                  and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of
                  RbRbR\_b and RsRsR\_s (i.e., ``signal to noise''
                  ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative
                  width). Through calculation of
                  $\beta$b$\beta$b$\backslash$beta \_b and
                  $\beta$s$\beta$s$\backslash$beta \_s, we obtain the

                  burst and spike synchronizations break up,
                  respectively. Consequently, it is shown in explicit
                  examples that the frequency-domain bursting and
                  spiking order parameters may be usefully used for
                  characterization of the bursting and the spiking

                  stimulation (tSOS; 0.75 Hz) was previously shown to
                  enhance widespread endogenous EEG slow oscillatory
                  activity when applied during a sleep period
                  characterized by emerging endogenous slow
                  oscillatory activity. Processes of memory
                  consolidation typically occurring during this state
                  of sleep were also enhanced. Here, we show that the
                  same tSOS applied in the waking brain also induced
                  an increase in endogenous EEG slow oscillations
                  (0.4\textendash{}1.2 Hz), although in a
                  topographically restricted fashion. Applied during

                  related memory processes induced by tSOS critically
                  depend on brain state. In response to tSOS during

                  whether this picture can be justified and study the
                  four-dimensional neuron model of Hodgkin and Huxley
                  as a concrete example. The model is approximated by
                  a response kernel expansion in terms of a single
                  variable, the membrane voltage. The first-order term
                  is linear in the input and its kernel has the
                  typical form of an elementary postsynaptic
                  potential. Higher-order kernels take care of
                  nonlinear interactions between input spikes. In
                  contrast to the standard Volterra expansion, the
                  kernels depend on the firing time of the most recent
                  output spike. In particular, a zero-order kernel
                  that describes the shape of the spike and the
                  typical after-potential is included. Our model
                  neuron fires if the membrane voltage, given by the
                  truncated response kernel expansion, crosses a
                  threshold. The threshold model is tested on a spike
                  train generated by the Hodgkin-Huxley model with a
                  stochastic input current. We find that the threshold
                  model predicts 90 percent of the spikes
                  correctly. Our results show that, to good
                  approximation, the description of a neuron as a
                  threshold element can indeed be justified.},

                  range of firing patterns. They normally fire
                  constantly at a low rate, and speed up, firing a
                  phasic burst when reward exceeds prediction, or
                  pause when an expected reward does not
                  occur. Therefore, the detection of bursts and pauses

                  in spike trains simultaneously. We found that the
                  RGS method is adaptable to various patterns of spike
                  trains recorded in vivo, and is not influenced by
                  baseline firing rate, making it applicable to all in
                  vivo spike trains where baseline firing rates vary
                  over time. We compare the performance of the RGS
                  method to other methods of detecting bursts, such as
                  the Poisson Surprise (PS), Rank Surprise (RS), and
                  Template methods. Analysis of data using the RGS
                  method reveals potential mechanisms underlying how
                  bursts and pauses are controlled in DA neurons.},

  abstract     = {Locomotor burst generation is simulated using a
                  full-scale network model of the unilateral
                  excitatory interneuronal population. Earlier
                  small-scale models predicted that a population of
                  excitatory neurons would be sufficient to produce
                  burst activity, and this has recently been
                  experimentally confirmed. Here we simulate the
                  hemicord activity induced under various experimental
                  conditions, including pharmacological activation by
                  NMDA and AMPA as well as electrical stimulation. The
                  model network comprises a realistic number of cells
                  and synaptic connectivity patterns. Using similar
                  distributions of cellular and synaptic parameters,
                  as have been estimated experimentally, a large
                  variation in dynamic characteristics like firing
                  rates, burst, and cycle durations were seen in
                  single cells. On the network level an overall rhythm
                  was generated because the synaptic interactions
                  cause partial synchronization within the
                  population. This network rhythm not only emerged
                  despite the distributed cellular parameters but
                  relied on this variability, in particular, in
                  reproducing variations of the activity during the
                  cycle and showing recruitment in interneuronal
                  populations. A slow rhythm (0.4\textendash{}2 Hz)
                  can be induced by tonic activation of NMDA-sensitive
                  channels, which are voltage dependent and generate
                  depolarizing plateaus. The rhythm emerges through a
                  synchronization of bursts of the individual
                  neurons. A fast rhythm (4\textendash{}12 Hz),
                  induced by AMPA, relies on spike synchronization
                  within the population, and each burst is composed of
                  single spikes produced by different neurons. The
                  dynamic range of the fast rhythm is limited by the
                  ability of the network to synchronize oscillations
                  and depends on the strength of synaptic connections
                  and the duration of the slow after
                  hyperpolarization. The model network also produces
                  prolonged bouts of rhythmic activity in response to
                  brief electrical activations, as seen
                  experimentally. The mutual excitation can sustain
                  long-lasting activity for a realistic set of
                  synaptic parameters. The bout duration depends on
                  the strength of excitatory synaptic connections, the
                  level of persistent depolarization, and the influx
                  of Ca2+ ions and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+
                  current.},

  abstract     = {The vertebrate central nervous system is organized
                  in modules that independently execute sophisticated
                  tasks. Such modules are flexibly controlled and
                  operate with a considerable degree of autonomy. One
                  example is locomotion generated by spinal central
                  pattern generator networks (CPGs) that shape the
                  detailed motor output. The level of activity is
                  controlled from brainstem locomotor command centers,
                  which in turn, are under the control of the basal
                  ganglia. By using a biophysically detailed,
                  full-scale computational model of the lamprey CPG
                  (10,000 neurons) and its brainstem/forebrain

                  that can adapt the network to different
                  demands. Forward or backward locomotion and steering
                  can be flexibly controlled by local synaptic effects
                  limited to only the very rostral part of the
                  network. Variability in response properties within
                  each neuronal population is an essential feature and

                  frequency bands. Methods: ERD/ERS responses of the
                  4\textendash{}6, 6\textendash{}8, 8\textendash{}10
                  and 10\textendash{}12 Hz EEG frequency bands were
                  studied in 24 normal subjects performing a visual
                  sequential letter task (so-called n-back task) in
                  which memory load was varied from 0 to 2. Results:
                  In the 4\textendash{}6 Hz theta frequency band, a
                  long-lasting synchronization was observed in the
                  anterior electrodes, especially after the
                  presentation of targets. In the 6\textendash{}8 and
                  8\textendash{}10 Hz frequency bands, anterior ERS
                  was elicited especially in the 2-back condition
                  (highest memory load). In contrast to the responses
                  of the 8\textendash{}10 Hz frequency band, in the
                  10\textendash{}12 Hz frequency band the 2-back
                  experimental condition elicited the greatest
                  ERD. Conclusions: In the highest memory load
                  (2-back) experimental condition the attentional
                  capacities were most probably exceeded, resulting in
                  6\textendash{}8 and 8\textendash{}10 Hz ERS. This
                  might reflect an inhibition of such brain areas
                  (frontal cortices) no longer involved in task
                  completion when alternative strategies are needed
                  and utilized. These more `cognitive' strategies were
                  then reflected as an increase in 10\textendash{}12
                  Hz ERD. Additionally, our results support the
                  assumption that the simultaneously recorded ERD/ERS
                  responses of different narrow EEG frequency bands
                  differ and reflect distinct aspects of information

                  solver for two-point boundary value problems (BVPs);
                  see also Chaps. 1 and 2. In conjunction with
                  pseudo-arclength continuation, it is possible to
                  find the solution of a two-point BVP and then
                  continue it in parameters. This basic idea will be
                  known to most readers as the standard technique to
                  compute a one-parameter branch of periodic
                  orbits. However, the continuation of BVPs is a much
                  more versatile tool and the solution need not be a
                  periodic orbit, but may be any specified orbit
                  segment. For example, the continuation of a suitable
                  orbit segment is utilized in the HomCont extension
                  for the computation of connecting orbits; see [7]

                  the idea of representing an invariant global
                  manifold of a dynamical system as a family of orbit
                  segments, which can then be computed as a solution
                  family of a suitable BVP. Note that the thus
                  computed object lies entirely in the phase space,
                  rather than the product of phase space and parameter

                  activity of native N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
                  receptors in hippocampal neurons, a phenomenon
                  termed Ca2+-dependent inactivation. We examined
                  inactivation in heteromeric NMDA receptors expressed
                  in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using
                  whole-cell recording. NR1-1a/2A heteromers showed
                  reversible inactivation that was very similar to
                  native NMDA receptors in cultured hippocampal
                  neurons. Inactivation was dependent on the
                  extracellular Ca2+ concentration and the degree of
                  intracellular Ca2+ buffering. In 2 mM extracellular
                  Ca2+, inactivation resulted in a 46.1 +/- 12.6\%
                  reduction in the whole-cell current during a 5-sec
                  agonist application. Inactivation of NR1-1a/2A
                  heteromers was unaffected by calcineurin inhibitors,
                  staurosporine, or phalloidin. NR1-1a/2D heteromers
                  also showed a similar degree of inactivation. In
                  contrast, NR1-1a/2B and NR1-1a/2C heteromers showed
                  no significant inactivation. At saturating
                  concentrations of NMDA (1 mM), NR1-1a/2A heteromers
                  also showed Ca- and glycine-independent
                  desensitization, as seen in native hippocampal
                  neurons. Ca(2+)- and glycine-independent
                  desensitization was less pronounced in NR1-1a/2B
                  heteromers and absent in NR1-1a/2C
                  heteromers. Activation of NR1-1a/2C heteromers
                  triggered intracellular Ca2+ transients similar to
                  NR1-1a/2A heteromers as verified by combined Ca2+
                  imaging and whole-cell recording. Thus differences
                  in Ca2+ permeability were not responsible for the
                  lack of inactivation in NR1-1a/2C heteromers. Our
                  results show that inactivation of recombinant NMDA
                  receptors requires either the NR2A or NR2D subunit,
                  whereas both inactivation and desensitization were
                  absent in NR2C-containing receptors. The gating of
                  inactivating NMDA receptors is more likely to be
                  influenced by ongoing NMDA receptor activity and
                  Ca2+ transients, perhaps consistent with the
                  prominent expression of NR2A in hippocampus and

                  hyperpolarized subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons
                  engage in slow, regular burst firing when treated
                  with an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) bath. A
                  depolarization-activated inward current (DIC) has
                  been hypothesized to contribute to this bursting
                  activity. To explore the mechanism for STN burst
                  firing in this setting, we augmented a previously
                  published conductance-based computational model for
                  single rat STN neurons to include both DIC and NMDA
                  currents, fit to data from published
                  electrophysiological recordings. Simulations show
                  that with these additions, the model engages in
                  bursting activity at $<$1 Hz in response to
                  hyperpolarizing current injection and that this
                  bursting exhibits several features observed
                  experimentally in STN. Furthermore, a reduced model
                  is used to show that the combination of NMDA and DIC
                  currents, but not either alone, suffices to generate
                  oscillations under hyperpolarizing current
                  injection. STN neurons show enhanced burstiness in
                  Parkinson's disease patients and experimental models
                  of parkinsonism, and the burst mechanism studied
                  presently could contribute to this effect.},

                  type and of some related systems. Such systems,

                  interacting similar subunits, are considered as
                  typical synergetic systems. ber Because each local
                  subunit itself represents an active dynamical system
                  function ing only in far-from-equilibrium
                  situations, the entire system is capable of showing
                  a variety of curious pattern formations and

                  thermodynamic cooperative fields. I personally
                  believe that the nonlinear dynamics, deterministic
                  or statistical, of fields composed of similar active
                  (Le., non-equilibrium) elements will form an

                  be highly desirable. In this connection, this book
                  pushes for ward a particular physical viewpoint
                  based on the slaving principle. The dis covery of

                  the first edition of this book proved that the basic
                  principles used to select and present the material
                  made sense. The idea was to write a simple text that
                  could serve as a seri ous introduction to the
                  subject. Of course, the meaning of "simplicity"
                  varies from person to person and from country to
                  country. The word "introduction" contains even more
                  ambiguity. To start reading this book, only a moder
                  ate knowledge of linear algebra and calculus is
                  required. Other preliminaries, qualified as
                  "elementary" in modern mathematics, are explicitly
                  formulated in the book. These include the Fredholm
                  Alternative for linear systems and the
                  multidimensional Implicit Function Theorem. Using
                  these very limited tools, a framewo:k of notions,
                  results, and methods is gradually built that allows
                  one to read (and possibly write) scientific papers
                  on bifurcations of nonlinear dynamical
                  systems. Among other things, progress in the
                  sciences means that mathematical results and methods
                  that once were new become standard and routinely
                  used by the research and development
                  community. Hopefully, this edition of the book will
                  contribute to this process. The book's structure has
                  been kept intact. Most of the changes introduced
                  reflect recent theoretical and software developments
                  in which the author was involved. Important changes
                  in the third edition can be summarized as follows. A
                  new section devoted to the fold-flip bifurcation for
                  maps has appeared in Chapter 9.},

                  is organized into external (ECL) and internal (ICL)
                  cellular layers separated by the lateral olfactory
                  tract (LOT). The most superficial layer, or
                  vomeronasal nerve layer, is composed of two fiber
                  contingents that distribute in rostral and caudal
                  halves. The second layer, or glomerular layer, is
                  also divided by a conspicuous invagination of the
                  neuropil of the ECL at the junction of the rostral
                  and caudal halves. The ECL contains eight cell types
                  distributed in three areas: a subglomerular area
                  containing juxtaglomerular and superficial
                  short-axon neurons, an intermediate area harboring
                  large principal cells (LPC), or mitral and tufted
                  cells, and a deep area containing dwarf, external
                  granule, polygonal, and round projecting cells. The
                  ICL contains two neuron types: internal granule
                  (IGC) and main accessory cells (MACs). The dendrites
                  and axons of LPCs in the two AOB halves are
                  organized symmetrically with respect to an
                  anatomical plane called linea alba. The LPC axon
                  collaterals may recruit adjacent intrinsic, possibly
                  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic, neurons that,
                  in turn, interact with the dendrites of the adjacent
                  LPCs. These modules may underlie the process of
                  decoding pheromonal clues. The most rostral ICL
                  contains another neuron group termed interstitial
                  neurons of the bulbi (INBs) that includes both
                  intrinsic and projecting neurons. MACs and INBs
                  share inputs from fiber efferents arising in the
                  main olfactory bulb (MOB) and AOB and send axons to
                  IGCs. Because IGCs are a well-known source of
                  modulatory inputs to LPCs, both MACs and INBs
                  represent a site of convergence of the MOB with the

                  collections (2-7) of spontaneously active single
                  units in the striate cortex of unanesthetized cats,
                  by means of chronically implanted electrodes. The
                  recorded spike trains were computer scanned for
                  bursts of spikes, and the bursts were catalogued and
                  studied. The firing rates of the neurons ranged from
                  0.16 to 32 spikes/s; the mean was 8.9 spikes/s, the
                  standard deviation 7.0 spikes/s. Bursts of spikes
                  were assigned a quantitative measure, termed Poisson
                  surprise (S), defined as the negative logarithm of
                  their probability in a random (Poisson) spike
                  train. Only bursts having S greater than 10,
                  corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 0.01
                  bursts/1,000 spikes in a random spike train, were
                  considered to be of interest. Bursts having S
                  greater than 10 occurred at a rate of about 5-15
                  bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min. The
                  rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging
                  about 2 bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and
                  about 4.5 bursts/min for neurons having 30
                  spikes/s. About 21\% of the recorded units emitted
                  significantly fewer bursts than the rest (below 1
                  burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these neurons
                  was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during
                  bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average
                  spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter
                  bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and
                  lasted 0.5-2.0 s. When the number of spikes in the
                  successively emitted bursts was listed, it was found
                  that in some neurons these numbers were not
                  distributed at random but were clustered around one
                  or more preferred values. In this sense, bursts
                  occasionally "recurred" a few times in a few
                  minutes. The finding suggests that neurons are
                  highly reliable. When bursts of two or more

                  spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter
                  bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and

                  by its use of bidirectional synaptic transmission at
                  dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses. These
                  reciprocal synapses provide tight coupling of
                  inhibitory feedback from granule cell interneurons
                  to mitral cell projection neurons in the accessory
                  olfactory bulb (AOB), at the first stage of
                  vomeronasal processing. It has been proposed that
                  both the mGluR2 agonist DCG-IV and noradrenaline
                  promote mate recognition memory formation by
                  reducing GABAergic feedback on mitral cells. The
                  resultant mitral cell disinhibition is thought to
                  induce a long-lasting enhancement in the gain of
                  inhibitory feedback from granule to mitral cells,
                  which selectively gates the transmission of the
                  learned chemosensory information. However, we found
                  that local infusions of both noradrenaline and
                  DCG-IV failed to disinhibit AOB neural activity in
                  urethane-anaesthetised mice. DCG-IV infusion had
                  similar effects to the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine,
                  suggesting that it increased GABAergic inhibition in
                  the AOB rather than reducing it. Noradrenaline
                  infusion into the AOB also failed to disinhibit
                  mitral cells in awake mice despite inducing
                  long-term increases in power of AOB local field
                  potentials, similar to those observed following
                  memory formation. These results suggest that mitral
                  cell disinhibition is not essential for the neural
                  changes in the AOB that underlie mate recognition
                  memory formation in mice.},

                  vitro by the glutamate agonist
                  N-methyl-d-aspartate. It has been suggested that the
                  interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion
                  by a ouabain-sensitive pump [Johnson et
                  al. (1992)Science258, 665\textendash{}667]. We
                  formulate and explore a theoretical model, with a
                  minimal number of currents, for this novel mechanism
                  of burst generation. This minimal model is further
                  developed into a more elaborate model based on
                  observations of additional currents and hypotheses
                  about their spatial distribution in dopaminergic
                  neurons [Hounsgaard (1992)Neuroscience50,
                  513\textendash{}518; Llin{\'a}s et al. (1984)Brain
                  Res.294, 127\textendash{}132]. Using the minimal
                  model, we confirm that interaction between the
                  regenerative, inward N-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated
                  current and the outward Na+-pump current is
                  sufficient to generate the slow oscillation
                  ($\sim$0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The
                  negative-slope region of the N-methyl-d-aspartate
                  channel's current-voltage relation is indispensable
                  for this slow rhythm generation. The time-scale of
                  Na+-handling determines the burst's slow
                  frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the
                  constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is
                  best explained mechanistically by using at least two
                  spatial, cable-like compartments: a soma where
                  action potentials are produced and a dendritic
                  compartment where the slow rhythm is generated. Our
                  result is consistent with recent experimental
                  evidence that burst generation originates in distal
                  dendrites [Seutin et al. (1994)Neuroscience58,
                  201\textendash{}206]. Responses of the model to a
                  number of electrophysiological and pharmacological
                  stimuli are consistent with known responses observed
                  under similar conditions. These include the
                  persistence of the slow rhythm when the
                  tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is blocked and
                  when the soma is voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Using
                  our more elaborate model, we account for details of
                  the observed frequency adaptation in
                  N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of
                  multiple spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the
                  interaction between two different bursting
                  mechanisms. Besides reproducing several well
                  established firing patterns, this model also
                  suggests that new firing modes, not yet recorded,
                  might also occur in dopaminergic neurons.  This
                  model provides mechanistic insights and explanations
                  into the origin of a variety of experimentally
                  observed membrane potential firing patterns in
                  dopaminergic neurons, including
                  N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced bursting and its
                  dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of
                  reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of
                  dopaminergic neurons, could be useful in further
                  studies of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor
                  circuit. It may also shed light on bursting that
                  involves N-methyl-d-aspartate channel activity in

  abstract     = {Unlike the monosynaptic ``stretch'' reflex, the
                  exact neuronal pathway for a simple cutaneous reflex
                  has not yet been defined in any vertebrate. In young
                  frog tadpoles, we made whole-cell recordings from
                  pairs of spinal neurons. We found direct,
                  excitatory, glutamatergic synapses from
                  touch-sensitive skin-sensory neurons to sensory
                  pathway interneurons, and then from these sensory
                  interneurons to motoneurons and premotor
                  interneurons on the other side of the body. We
                  conclude that the minimal pathway for this primitive
                  reflex, in which stroking the skin on one side leads
                  to flexion on the other side, is disynaptic. This
                  detailed circuit information has allowed us to ask
                  whether the properties of glutamatergic synapses
                  during the first day of CNS development are tuned to
                  their function in the tadpole's responses. Stroking
                  the skin excites a few sensory neurons. These
                  activate primarily AMPA receptors producing short,
                  strong excitation that activates many sensory
                  pathway interneurons but only allows temporal
                  summation of closely synchronous inputs. In
                  contrast, the excitation produced in contralateral
                  neurons by the sensory pathway interneurons is weak
                  and primarily mediated by NMDA receptors. As a
                  result, considerable summation is required for this
                  excitation to lead to postsynaptic neuron firing and
                  a contralateral flexion. We conclude that from their
                  early functioning, synapses from sensory neurons are
                  strong and those from sensory pathway interneurons
                  are weak. The distribution of glutamate receptors at
                  synapses in this developing circuit is tuned so that
                  synapses have properties suited to their roles in
                  the whole animal's reflex responses.},

                  simulated in previous theoretical studies on
                  neuronal models. The results revealed a general
                  principle of neuronal firing pattern transitions. In
                  this letter, three types of bifurcation scenarios
                  with respect to extracellar calcium concentration
                  ([Ca++]o) were discovered in experiments on neural
                  pacemakers. Such a series of bifurcation scenarios
                  implied complex structure of bifurcations in the
                  firing pattern transitions of neurons. In the
                  two-dimensional parameter space of Chay model, three
                  classical kinds of bifurcation scenarios with
                  respect to the bifurcation parameter vc (the reverse
                  potential of calcium concentration) were
                  simulated. By the variation of the conditional
                  parameter, $\lambda$n, the relationship among the
                  three bifurcation scenarios was revealed. The
                  results not only verified the existence of different
                  bifurcation scenarios in real neuronal system, but
                  also indicated that the differences among the
                  bifurcation scenarios were caused by the different
                  configuration of parameters. The physiological
                  significance of such bifurcation structures to a
                  deeper understanding of neural coding mechanism was

  abstract     = {Motor networks typically generate several related
                  output patterns or gaits where individual neurons
                  may be shared or recruited between patterns. We
                  investigate how a vertebrate locomotor network is
                  reconfigured to produce a second rhythmic motor
                  pattern, defining the detailed pattern of neuronal
                  recruitment and consequent changes in the mechanism
                  for rhythm generation. Hatchling Xenopus tadpoles
                  swim if touched, but when held make slower,
                  stronger, struggling movements. In immobilized
                  tadpoles, a brief current pulse to the skin
                  initiates swimming, whereas 40 Hz pulses produce
                  struggling. The classes of neurons active during
                  struggling are defined using whole-cell patch
                  recordings from hindbrain and spinal cord neurons
                  during 40 Hz stimulation of the skin. Some
                  motoneurons and inhibitory interneurons are active
                  in both swimming and struggling, but more neurons
                  are recruited within these classes during
                  struggling. In addition, and in contrast to a
                  previous study, we describe two new classes of
                  excitatory interneuron specifically recruited during
                  struggling and define their properties and synaptic
                  connections. We then explore mechanisms that
                  generate struggling by building a network model
                  incorporating these new neurons. As well as the
                  recruitment of new neuron classes, we show that
                  reconfiguration of the locomotor network to the
                  struggling central pattern generator (CPG) reveals a
                  context-dependent synaptic depression of reciprocal
                  inhibition: the result of increased inhibitory
                  neuron firing frequency during struggling. This
                  provides one possible mechanism for burst
                  termination not seen in the swimming CPG. The direct
                  demonstration of depression in reciprocal inhibition
                  confirms a key element of Brown's (1911) hypothesis

  abstract     = {Rhythmic activity is central to brain function. In
                  the vertebrate CNS, the neuronal circuits for
                  breathing and locomotion involve inhibition and also
                  neurons acting as pacemakers, but identifying the
                  neurons responsible has proven difficult. By
                  studying simple hatchling Xenopus laevis tadpoles,
                  we have already identified a population of
                  electrically coupled hindbrain neurons (dINs) that
                  drive swimming. During rhythm generation, dINs
                  release glutamate to excite each other and activate
                  NMDA receptors (NMDARs). The resulting
                  depolarization enables a network mechanism for
                  swimming rhythm generation that depends on
                  reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic right and
                  left sides. Surprisingly, a surgically isolated
                  hemi-CNS without inhibition can still generate
                  swimming-like rhythms. We have now discovered that
                  activation of NMDARs transforms dINs, which normally
                  fire singly to current injection, into pacemakers
                  firing within the normal swimming frequency range
                  (10\textendash{}25 Hz). When dIN firing is blocked
                  pharmacologically, this NMDAR activation produces 10
                  Hz membrane potential oscillations that persist when
                  electrical coupling is blocked but not when the
                  voltage-dependent gating of NMDARs by Mg2+ is
                  removed. The NMDA-induced oscillations and pacemaker
                  firing at swimming frequency are unique to the dIN
                  population and do not occur in other spinal
                  neurons. We conclude that NMDAR-mediated
                  self-resetting switches critical neurons that drive
                  swimming into pacemaker mode only during locomotion

                  neurons in the central-pattern-generator (CPG)
                  circuit in the spinal cord. Synaptic connections in
                  the CPG and pacemaker properties in certain CPG
                  neurons, both may contribute to generation of the
                  rhythms. In the half-center model proposed by Graham
                  Brown a century ago, reciprocal inhibition plays a
                  critical role. However, in all vertebrate
                  preparations examined, rhythmic motor bursts can be
                  induced when inhibition is blocked in the spinal
                  cord. Without inhibition, neuronal pacemaker
                  properties may become more important in generation
                  of the rhythms. Pacemaker properties have been found
                  in motoneurons and some premotor interneurons in
                  different vertebrates and they can be dependent on
                  N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDAR) or
                  rely on other ionic currents like persistent inward
                  currents. In the swimming circuit of the hatchling
                  Xenopus tadpole, there is substantial evidence that
                  emergent network properties can give rise to
                  swimming rhythms. During fictive swimming,
                  excitatory interneurons (dINs) in the caudal
                  hindbrain fire earliest on each swimming cycle and
                  their spikes drive the firing of other CPG
                  neurons. Regenerative dIN firing itself relies on
                  reciprocal inhibition and background excitation. We
                  now find that the activation of NMDARs can change
                  dINs from firing singly at rest to current injection
                  to firing repetitively at swimming frequencies. When
                  action potentials are blocked, some intrinsic
                  membrane potential oscillations at about 10 Hz are
                  revealed, which may underlie repetitive dIN firing
                  during NMDAR activation. In confirmation of this,
                  dIN repetitive firing persists in NMDA when synaptic
                  transmission is blocked by Cd2+. When inhibition is
                  blocked, only dINs and motoneurons are functional in
                  the spinal circuit. We propose that the conditional
                  intrinsic NMDAR-dependent pacemaker firing of dINs
                  can drive the production of swimming-like rhythms
                  without the participation of inhibitory
                  neurotransmission.},

                  multiple olfactory bulb (OB) functions, including
                  odor discrimination, perceptual learning, and
                  short-term memory. Previous studies have shown that
                  nicotinic cholinergic receptor activation sharpens
                  mitral cell chemoreceptive fields, likely via
                  intraglomerular circuitry. Muscarinic cholinergic
                  activation is less well understood, though
                  muscarinic receptors are implicated in olfactory
                  learning and in the regulation of synchronized
                  oscillatory dynamics in hippocampus and cortex. To
                  understand the mechanisms underlying cholinergic
                  neuromodulation in OB, we developed a biophysical
                  model of the OB neuronal network including both
                  glomerular layer and external plexiform layer (EPL)
                  computations and incorporating both nicotinic and
                  muscarinic neuromodulatory effects. Our simulations
                  show how nicotinic activation within glomerular
                  circuits sharpens mitral cell chemoreceptive fields,
                  even in the absence of EPL circuitry, but does not
                  facilitate intrinsic oscillations or spike
                  synchronization. In contrast, muscarinic receptor
                  activation increases mitral cell spike
                  synchronization and field oscillatory power by
                  potentiating granule cell excitability and lateral
                  inhibitory interactions within the EPL, but it has
                  little effect on mitral cell firing rates and hence
                  does not sharpen olfactory representations under a
                  rate metric. These results are consistent with the
                  theory that EPL interactions regulate the timing,
                  rather than the existence, of mitral cell action
                  potentials and perform their computations with
                  respect to a spike timing-based metric. This general
                  model suggests that the roles of nicotinic and
                  muscarinic receptors in olfactory bulb are both
                  distinct and complementary to one another, together
                  regulating the effects of ascending cholinergic
                  inputs on olfactory bulb transformations.},

  abstract     = {Many neural circuits are capable of generating
                  multiple stereotyped outputs after different sensory
                  inputs or neuromodulation. We have previously
                  identified the central pattern generator (CPG) for
                  Xenopus tadpole swimming that involves antiphase
                  oscillations of activity between the left and right
                  sides. Here we analyze the cellular basis for
                  spontaneous left\textendash{}right motor synchrony
                  characterized by simultaneous bursting on both sides
                  at twice the swimming frequency. Spontaneous
                  synchrony bouts are rare in most tadpoles, and they
                  instantly emerge from and switch back to swimming,
                  most frequently within the first second after skin
                  stimulation. Analyses show that only neurons that
                  are active during swimming fire action potentials in
                  synchrony, suggesting both output patterns derive
                  from the same neural circuit. The firing of
                  excitatory descending interneurons (dINs) leads that
                  of other types of neurons in synchrony as it does in
                  swimming. During synchrony, the time window between
                  phasic excitation and inhibition is 7.9 $\pm$ 1 ms,
                  shorter than that in swimming (41 $\pm$ 2.3 ms). The
                  occasional, extra midcycle firing of dINs during
                  swimming may initiate synchrony, and mismatches of
                  timing in the left and right activity can switch
                  synchrony back to swimming. Computer modeling
                  supports these findings by showing that the same
                  neural network, in which reciprocal inhibition
                  mediates rebound firing, can generate both swimming
                  and synchrony without circuit
                  reconfiguration. Modeling also shows that
                  lengthening the time window between phasic
                  excitation and inhibition by increasing dIN
                  synaptic/conduction delay can improve the stability
                  of synchrony.},

                  is concerned with the construction, analysis, and
                  interpretation of mathematical models that shed
                  light on significant problems in the natural
                  sciences. It is intended to provide material of
                  interest to students in mathematics, science, and
                  engineering at the upper undergraduate and graduate
                  level. Classroom testing of preliminary versions
                  indicates that many such students do in fact find
                  the material interesting and worthy of study. There
                  is little doubt that a course such as one based on
                  this text should form part of the core curriculum
                  for applied mathematicians. Moreover, in the last
                  few years the professional mathematical community in
                  the United States has emphasized the importance of
                  some exposure to applied mathematics for all
                  mathematics students. This exposure is recommended
                  because of its broadening influence, and (for future
                  university mathematicians) because of the benefits
                  it affords in preparing for the teaching of
                  nonspecialists. As for scientists and engineers,
                  there is often little difference in their
                  theoretical work and that of an applied
                  mathematician, so they should find something of
                  value in the approaches to problems that we
                  espouse. There are many books that present
                  collections of useful mathematical techniques and
                  illustrate the various techniques by solving
                  classical problems of mathematical physics. Our
                  approach is different. Typically, we select an
                  important scientific problem whose solution will
                  involve some useful mathematics. After briefly
                  discussing the required scientific background, we
                  formulate a relevant mathematical problem with some
                  care. (The formulation step is often difficult. Not
                  many books actually demonstrate this, but we try to
                  give due weight to the challenges involved in
                  constructing our mathematical models.) A new
                  technique may then be introduced to solve the
                  mathematical problem, or a technique known in
                  simpler contexts may be generalized. In most
                  instances we take care to determine what the
                  mathematical results tell us about the scientific
                  processes that motivated the problem in the first
                  place.},

                  for breathing in mammals provide a theoretical and
                  computational framework bringing together
                  experimental data obtained from different animal
                  preparations under various experimental
                  conditions. Many of these models were developed in
                  parallel and iteratively with experimental studies
                  and provided predictions guiding new
                  experiments. This data-driven modeling approach has
                  advanced our understanding of respiratory network
                  architecture and neural mechanisms underlying
                  generation of the respiratory rhythm and pattern,
                  including their functional reorganization under
                  different physiological conditions. Models reviewed
                  here vary in neurobiological details and
                  computational complexity and span multiple
                  spatiotemporal scales of respiratory control
                  mechanisms. Recent models describe interacting
                  populations of respiratory neurons spatially
                  distributed within the B{\"o}tzinger and
                  pre-B{\"o}tzinger complexes and rostral
                  ventrolateral medulla that contain core circuits of
                  the respiratory central pattern generator
                  (CPG). Network interactions within these circuits
                  along with intrinsic rhythmogenic properties of
                  neurons form a hierarchy of multiple rhythm
                  generation mechanisms. The functional expression of
                  these mechanisms is controlled by input drives from
                  other brainstem components, including the
                  retrotrapezoid nucleus and pons, which regulate the
                  dynamic behavior of the core circuitry. The emerging
                  view is that the brainstem respiratory network has
                  rhythmogenic capabilities at multiple levels of
                  circuit organization. This allows flexible,
                  state-dependent expression of different neural
                  pattern-generation mechanisms under various
                  physiological conditions, enabling a wide repertoire
                  of respiratory behaviors. Some models consider
                  control of the respiratory CPG by pulmonary feedback
                  and network reconfiguration during defensive
                  behaviors such as cough. Future directions in
                  modeling of the respiratory CPG are
                  considered. Published 2012. Compr Physiol

  abstract     = {Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used in
                  machine learning to account for spatial or temporal
                  relationships between multivariate random
                  variables. In this paper, we propose a formulation
                  of underdetermined source separation in
                  multidimensional spaces as a problem involving GP
                  regression. The advantage of the proposed approach
                  is firstly to provide a flexible means to include a
                  variety of prior information concerning the sources
                  and secondly to lead to minimum mean squared error
                  estimates. We show that if the additive GPs are
                  supposed to be locally-stationary, computations can
                  be done very efficiently in the frequency
                  domain. These findings establish a deep connection
                  between GP and nonnegative tensor factorizations
                  with the Itakura-Saito distance and we show that
                  when the signals are monodimensional, the resulting
                  framework coincides with many popular methods that

                  using spruce budworm and balsam fir as an
                  example. This consists of separating the state
                  variables into fast and slow categories. (2) The
                  dynamics of the fast variables are analysed first,
                  holding the slow variables fixed. Then the dynamics
                  of the slow variables are analysed, with the fast
                  variables held at corresponding equilibrium
                  values. If there are several such equilibria, there
                  are several possibilities for the slow dynamics. (3)
                  In the case of the budworm, this analysis exhibits
                  the possibility of `relaxation oscillations' which
                  are familiar from theory of the Van der Pol
                  oscillator. In more modern terminology, the jumps of
                  the system are governed by a cusp catastrophe. (4)
                  Such an analysis can be made on the basis of
                  qualitative information only, but additional insight
                  emerges when parameter ranges are defined by the
                  kind of information typically available from an
                  experienced biologist. (5) At the least this can be
                  a guide to assess subsequent priorities for both
                  research and policy.},

                  potential (AP) occurrence (``spike trains'') from
                  cellular fluorescence signals. It remains unclear
                  how experimental parameters such as signal-to-noise
                  ratio (SNR) and acquisition rate affect spike
                  inference and whether additional information about
                  network structure can be extracted. Here we present
                  a simulation framework for quantitatively assessing
                  how well spike dynamics and network topology can be
                  inferred from noisy calcium imaging data. For
                  simulated AP-evoked calcium transients in
                  neocortical pyramidal cells, we analyzed the quality
                  of spike inference as a function of SNR and data
                  acquisition rate using a recently introduced peeling
                  algorithm. Given experimentally attainable values of
                  SNR and acquisition rate, neural spike trains could
                  be reconstructed accurately and with up to
                  millisecond precision. We then applied statistical
                  neuronal network models to explore how remaining
                  uncertainties in spike inference affect estimates of
                  network connectivity and topological features of
                  network organization. We define the experimental

                  network has a scale-free structure and determine how
                  well hub neurons can be identified. Our findings
                  provide a benchmark for future calcium imaging

  abstract     = {Whether drugs that enhance cognition in healthy
                  individuals will appear in the near future has
                  become a topic of considerable interest. We address
                  this possibility using a three variable system
                  (psychological effect, neurobiological mechanism,
                  efficiency vs. capabilities) for classifying
                  candidates. Ritalin and modafinil, two currently
                  available compounds, operate on primary
                  psychological states that in turn affect cognitive
                  operations (attention, memory), but there is little
                  evidence that these effects translate into
                  improvements in complex cognitive processing. A
                  second category of potential enhancers includes
                  agents that improve memory encoding, generally
                  without large changes in primary psychological
                  states. Unfortunately, there is little information
                  on how these compounds affect cognitive performance
                  in standard psychological tests. Recent experiments
                  have identified a number of sites at which memory
                  drugs could, in principle, manipulate the cell
                  biological systems underlying the learning-related
                  long-term potentiation (LTP) effect; this may
                  explain the remarkable diversity of memory promoting
                  compounds. Indeed, many of these agents are known to
                  have positive effects on LTP. A possible third
                  category of enhancement drugs directed specifically
                  at integrated cognitive operations is nearly
                  empty. From a neurobiological perspective, two
                  plausible candidate classes have emerged that both
                  target the fast excitatory transmission responsible
                  for communication within cortical networks. One acts
                  on nicotinic receptors (alpha7, alpha4) that
                  regulate release of the neurotransmitter glutamate
                  while the other (`ampakines') allosterically
                  modulates the glutamate receptors mediating the
                  post-synaptic response (EPSCs). Brain imaging in
                  primates has shown that ampakines expand cortical
                  networks engaged by a complex task; coupled with
                  behavioral data, these findings provide evidence for
                  the possibility of generating new cognitive
                  capabilities. Finally, we suggest that continuing
                  advances in behavioral sciences provide new
                  opportunities for translational work, and that
                  discussions of the social impact of cognitive
                  enhancers have failed to consider the distinction
                  between effects on efficiency vs. new capabilities.},

                  synapses. We demonstrate the two modes of
                  oscillation in a hybrid circuit consisting of a
                  biological pacemaker and a model neuron,
                  reciprocally coupled via model depressing
                  synapses. We show that across a wide range of
                  parameter values this network shows robust
                  bistability of the oscillation mode and that it is
                  possible to switch the network from one mode to the
                  other by injection of a brief current pulse in
                  either neuron. The underlying mechanism for
                  bistability may be present in many types of circuits
                  with reciprocal connections and synaptic
                  depression.},

                  systems of lobsters and crabs have led to numerous
                  insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms
                  that generate rhythmic motor patterns. The small
                  number of easily identifiable neurons allowed the
                  establishment of connectivity diagrams among the
                  neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion. We now know
                  that (a) neuromodulatory substances reconfigure
                  circuit dynamics by altering synaptic strength and
                  voltage-dependent conductances and (b) individual

                  single-neuron and network homeostatic regulation
                  have provided insight into compensatory mechanisms

                  different activity regimes can coexist with each
                  other in a given neuron so that a transient stimulus
                  can cause a persistent change of activity. Such
                  multistability of the neuronal dynamics has in fact
                  been shown in a variety of neurons and can play
                  either a functional role or present a substrate for
                  neurological diseases. We explored the propensity
                  for multistability in a database of a leech heart
                  interneuron model, testing each case (parameter set)
                  in a database for multistability. We found a large
                  proportion of multistable cases, especially the
                  coexistence of silent and bursting regimes. This was
                  a surprising result, since these cells pace the
                  heartbeat of the leech, and the coexistence of
                  silence and bursting could disrupt the functional
                  pattern, threatening the viability of the
                  leech. Analysis of networks of mutually inhibitory
                  multistable neurons, however, showed robustness in
                  maintaining functional activity, suggesting that the
                  mutually inhibitory coupling can act as a protective
                  mechanism against failures induced by
                  multistability.},

                  behavior is critical for understanding normal and
                  pathological brain processes. Here we used
                  electrophysiology in mouse neocortical slices and
                  principles of nonlinear dynamics to demonstrate how
                  an increase in the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor
                  (NMDAR) conductance can create a nonlinear
                  whole-cell current-voltage ( I \textendash{} V )
                  relationship, which leads to changes in cellular
                  stability. We discovered two behaviorally and
                  morphologically distinct pyramidal cell
                  populations. Under control conditions, both cell
                  types responded to depolarizing current injection
                  with regular spiking patterns. However, upon NMDAR
                  activation, an intrinsic oscillatory (IO) cell type
                  (n = 44) showed a nonlinear whole-cell I
                  \textendash{} V relationship, intrinsic
                  voltage-dependent oscillations plus amplification of
                  alternating input current, and these properties
                  persisted after disabling action potential
                  generation with TTX. The other non-oscillatory (NO)
                  neuronal population (n = 24) demonstrated none of
                  these behaviors., Simultaneous intra- and
                  extracellular recordings demonstrated the NMDAR's
                  capacity to promote low-frequency seizure-like
                  network oscillations via its effects on intrinsic
                  neuronal properties. The two pyramidal cell types
                  demonstrated different relationships with network
                  oscillation: the IO cells were leaders that were
                  activated early in the population activity cycle
                  while the activation of the NO cell type was
                  distributed across network bursts. The properties of
                  IO neurons disappeared in a low magnesium
                  environment where the voltage-dependence of the
                  receptor is abolished; concurrently, the cellular
                  contribution to network oscillation switched to
                  synchronous firing. Thus, depending upon the
                  efficacy of NMDAR in altering the linearity of the
                  whole-cell current-voltage relationship, the two
                  cell populations played different roles in
                  sustaining network oscillation.},

                  have been identified as a potential mechanism to
                  help support or generate rhythmogenesis in neural
                  circuits. A genetically identified population of
                  ventromedial interneurons, called Hb9, in the mouse
                  spinal cord has been shown to generate TTX-resistant
                  membrane potential oscillations in the presence of
                  NMDA, serotonin and dopamine, but these oscillatory
                  properties are not well characterized. Hb9
                  interneurons are rhythmically active during fictive
                  locomotor-like behavior. In this study, we report
                  that exogenous N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA)
                  application is sufficient to produce membrane
                  potential oscillations in Hb9 interneurons. In
                  contrast, exogenous serotonin and dopamine
                  application, alone or in combination, are not
                  sufficient. The properties of NMDA-induced
                  oscillations vary among the Hb9 interneuron
                  population; their frequency and amplitude increase
                  with increasing NMDA concentration. NMDA does not
                  modulate the T-type calcium current (ICa(T)), which
                  is thought to be important in generating
                  locomotor-like activity, in Hb9 neurons. These
                  results suggest that NMDA receptor activation is
                  sufficient for the generation of TTX-resistant
                  NMDA-induced membrane potential oscillations in Hb9
                  interneurons.},

                  behavior displayed by central pattern generators and
                  other neural circuits. Understanding this complex
                  activity requires the knowledge of the interplay
                  between the intrinsic cell properties and the
                  properties of synaptic coupling between the
                  cells. Here we describe a simple method that allows
                  us to investigate the existence and stability of
                  anti-phase bursting solutions in a network of two
                  spiking neurons, each possessing a T-type calcium
                  current and coupled by reciprocal inhibition. We
                  derive a one-dimensional map which fully
                  characterizes the genesis and regulation of
                  anti-phase bursting arising from the interaction of
                  the T-current properties with the properties of
                  synaptic inhibition. This map is the burst length
                  return map formed as the composition of two distinct
                  one-dimensional maps that are each regulated by a
                  different set of model parameters. Although each map
                  is constructed using the properties of a single
                  isolated model neuron, the composition of the two
                  maps accurately captures the behavior of the full
                  network. We analyze the parameter sensitivity of
                  these maps to determine the influence of both the
                  intrinsic cell properties and the synaptic
                  properties on the burst length, and to find the
                  conditions under which multistability of several
                  bursting solutions is achieved. Although the
                  derivation of the map relies on a number of
                  simplifying assumptions, we discuss how the
                  principle features of this dimensional reduction
                  method could be extended to more realistic model
                  networks.},

  abstract     = {In this thesis we model two very different
                  movement-related neuronal circuits, both of which
                  produce oscillatory patterns of activity.  In one
                  case we study oscillatory activity in the basal
                  ganglia under both normal and Parkinsonian
                  conditions. First, we used a detailed Hodgkin-Huxley
                  type spiking model to investigate the activity
                  patterns that arise when oscillatory cortical input
                  is transmitted to the globus pallidus via the
                  subthalamic nucleus. Our model reproduced a result
                  from rodent studies which shows that two anti-phase
                  oscillatory groups of pallidal neurons appear under
                  Parkinsonian conditions. Secondly, we used a
                  population model of the basal ganglia to study
                  whether oscillations could be locally generated. The
                  basal ganglia are thought to be organised into
                  multiple parallel channels. In our model, isolated
                  channels could not generate oscillations, but if the
                  lateral inhibition between channels is sufficiently
                  strong then the network can act as a
                  rhythm-generating ``pacemaker'' circuit. This was
                  particularly true when we used a set of connection
                  strength parameters that represent the basal ganglia
                  under Parkinsonian conditions.  Since many things
                  are not known about the anatomy and
                  electrophysiology of the basal ganglia, we also
                  studied oscillatory activity in another, much
                  simpler, movement-related neuronal system: the
                  spinal cord of the Xenopus tadpole. We built a
                  computational model of the spinal cord containing
                  approximately 1,500 biologically realistic
                  Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, with synaptic connectivity
                  derived from a computational model of axon
                  growth. The model produced physiological swimming
                  behaviour and was used to investigate which aspects
                  of axon growth and neuron dynamics are behaviourally
                  important. We found that the oscillatory attractor
                  associated with swimming was remarkably stable,
                  which suggests that, surprisingly, many features of
                  axonal growth and synapse formation are not
                  necessary for swimming to emerge. We also studied
                  how the same spinal cord network can generate a
                  different oscillatory pattern in which neurons on
                  both sides of the body fire synchronously. Our
                  results here suggest that under normal conditions
                  the synchronous state is unstable or weakly stable,
                  but that even small increases in spike transmission
                  delays act to stabilise it.  Finally, we found that
                  although the basal ganglia and the tadpole spinal
                  cord are very different systems, the underlying
                  mechanism by which they can produce oscillations may
                  be remarkably similar. Insights from the tadpole
                  model allow us to predict how the basal ganglia
                  model may be capable of producing multiple patterns
                  of oscillatory activity.},

                  trade-off between the size of the network that can
                  be simulated and the complexity of the model used
                  for individual neurons. In this study, we describe a
                  generalization of the leaky integrate-and-fire model
                  that produces a wide variety of spiking behaviors
                  while still being analytically solvable between
                  firings. For different parameter values, the model
                  produces spiking or bursting, tonic, phasic or
                  adapting responses, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing
                  after potentials and so forth. The model consists of
                  a diagonalizable set of linear differential
                  equations describing the time evolution of membrane
                  potential, a variable threshold, and an arbitrary
                  number of firing-induced currents. Each of these
                  variables is modified by an update rule when the
                  potential reaches threshold. The variables used are
                  intuitive and have biological significance. The
                  model's rich behavior does not come from the
                  differential equations, which are linear, but rather
                  from complex update rules. This single-neuron model
                  can be implemented using algorithms similar to the
                  standard integrate-and-fire model. It is a natural
                  match with event-driven algorithms for which the
                  firing times are obtained as a solution of a
                  polynomial equation.},

                  be one of the key factors involved in various brain
                  computations. Central executive function typically
                  requires instantaneous coordination among the medial
                  prefrontal regions and other distant regions,
                  depending on the on-going task situation. In human
                  scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), the
                  medial prefrontal area is estimated to be the
                  current source of the theta rhythm, while there is
                  no direct evidence that the theta rhythm is involved
                  in the dynamic networking of central executive
                  circuits. Here we hypothesize that the central
                  executive circuit over the prefrontal and
                  task-related cortices is dynamically linked by theta
                  synchronization. By using simultaneous functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, we
                  elucidated cortical circuits emerging with theta
                  phase synchronization during free pacing repeated
                  subtraction. Theta phase synchronization in the
                  scalp EEG was found to emerge at two major clusters
                  of electrode pairs, between the right frontal and
                  left parietal sites and between the frontal and
                  right parietal sites. The phase synchronization of
                  two clusters is accompanied by fMRI responses in the
                  cortical regions responsible for central executive
                  function, working memory, visual imagery and
                  cognitive action sequence. Here we report the first
                  evidence that theta phase synchronization
                  dynamically coordinates the central executive
                  circuits, including the medial prefrontal cortex and

                  of NMDA applied to the most peripheral regions of
                  the dendritic tree elicited large somatic impedance
                  increases, indicating that the most peripheral
                  dendrites are well supplied with NMDA
                  receptors. Experiments done with kainate did not
                  elicit somatic responses to agonist applications on
                  peripheral dendrites. The data obtained are
                  consistent with the hypothesis that the activation
                  of NMDA receptors by exogenous glutamate is
                  significantly modified by the simultaneous
                  activation of non-NMDA receptors, which shunts the
                  NMDA response. The non-NMDA shunting hypothesis was
                  tested by a combined application of kainate and NMDA
                  to mimic the action of glutamate showing that the
                  shunting effect of non-NMDA receptor activation
                  virtually abolished the marked voltage dependency
                  typical of NMDA receptor activation. These data were
                  interpreted with a compartmental neuronal model
                  having both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors.},

  abstract     = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current
                  stimulation produce a variety of types of
                  oscillatory behavior when the internal medium
                  contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are
                  abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external
                  medium, or if the K+ conductance is
                  blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that
                  the cell's active conductance systems are
                  exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of
                  barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems
                  paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the
                  possible modes of behavior available to a system of
                  two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and
                  indicates a good correspondence to the types of
                  behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The
                  differential equations of a simple equivalent
                  circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of
                  some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear
                  mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a
                  propensity to produce damped or sustained
                  oscillations over a rather broad parameter range,
                  and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the
                  oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for
                  cells subject to changeable parameters (either from
                  cell to cell or with time during cellular activity),
                  a system dominated by two noninactivating
                  conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and
                  bistable behavior.},

                  particular spike-timing dependent plasticity
                  (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a
                  framework for classifying and evaluating different
                  models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological
                  synaptic models that are compatible with
                  integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each
                  neuron is described by a small number of
                  variables. This implies that synaptic update rules
                  for short-term or long-term plasticity can only
                  depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane
                  potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic
                  weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally
                  averaged) versions of the above variables. We
                  examine the ability of the models to account for
                  experimental data and to fulfill expectations
                  derived from theoretical considerations. We further
                  discuss their relations to teacher-based rules
                  (supervised learning) and reward-based rules

                  permit studies of Ca2+ dynamics in large numbers of
                  cells, in anesthetized and awake behaving
                  animals. However, unlike for electrophysiological
                  signals, standardized algorithms for assigning
                  optically recorded signals to individual cells have
                  not yet emerged. Here, we describe an automated
                  sorting procedure that combines independent
                  component analysis and image segmentation for
                  extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with
                  minimal human supervision. In validation studies
                  using simulated data, automated sorting

                  signals compared to conventional analysis based on

                  frequency-domain-voltage-clamp data of
                  NMDA-activated lamprey spinal neurons simultaneously
                  over a wide range of membrane potentials. A neuronal
                  cable model was used to explicitly take into account
                  receptors located on the dendritic trees. The
                  driving point membrane admittance was measured from
                  the cell soma in response to a Fourier synthesized
                  point voltage clamp stimulus. The data were fitted
                  to an equivalent cable model consisting of a single
                  lumped soma compartment coupled resistively to a
                  series of equal dendritic compartments. The model
                  contains voltage-dependent NMDA sensitive (INMDA),
                  slow potassium (IK), and leakage (IL) currents. Both
                  the passive cable properties and the voltage
                  dependence of ion channel kinetics were estimated,
                  including the electrotonic structure of the cell,
                  the steady-state gating characteristics, and the
                  time constants for particular voltage- and
                  time-dependent ionic conductances. An alternate
                  kinetic formulation was developed that consisted of
                  steady-state values for the gating parameters and
                  their time constants at half-activation values as
                  well as slopes of these parameters at
                  half-activation. This procedure allowed independent
                  restrictions on the magnitude and slope of both the
                  steady-state gating variable and its associated time
                  constant. Quantitative estimates of the
                  voltage-dependent membrane ion conductances and
                  their kinetic parameters were used to solve the
                  nonlinear equations describing dynamic
                  responses. The model accurately predicts current
                  clamp responses and is consistent with
                  experimentally measured TTX-resistant NMDA-induced
                  patterned activity. In summary, an analysis method
                  is developed that provides a pragmatic approach to

                  system.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic depression is a form of short-term
                  plasticity exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless,
                  the functional significance of synaptic depression
                  in oscillatory networks is not well understood. We
                  show that, in a recurrent inhibitory network that
                  includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic
                  depression can give rise to two distinct modes of
                  network operation. When the maximal conductance of
                  the depressing synapse is small, the oscillation
                  period is determined by the oscillator
                  component. Increasing the maximal conductance beyond
                  a threshold value activates a positive-feedback
                  mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic
                  strength. In this mode, the oscillation period is
                  determined by the strength and dynamics of the
                  depressing synapse. Because of the regenerative
                  nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can be
                  switched from one mode of operation to another by a
                  very small change in the maximal conductance of the
                  depressing synapse. Our model was inspired by
                  experimental work on the pyloric network of the
                  lobster. The pyloric network produces a simple motor
                  rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that receives
                  feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In
                  some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no
                  effect on the period of the rhythm, whereas in other
                  preparations, there was a significant decrease in
                  the period. We propose that the pyloric network can
                  operate in either of the two modes suggested by the
                  model, depending on the maximal conductance of the
                  depressing synapse.},

                  versatility of a simple two-equation model: the
                  adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron. We
                  show that this model generates multiple firing
                  patterns depending on the choice of parameter
                  values, and present a phase diagram describing the
                  transition from one firing type to another. We give
                  an analytical criterion to distinguish between
                  continuous adaption, initial bursting, regular
                  bursting and two types of tonic spiking. Also, we
                  report that the deterministic model is capable of
                  producing irregular spiking when stimulated with
                  constant current, indicating low-dimensional
                  chaos. Lastly, the simple model is fitted to real
                  experiments of cortical neurons under step current
                  stimulation. The results provide support for the
                  suitability of simple models such as the adaptive
                  exponential integrate-and-fire neuron for large
                  network simulations.},

                  a national program based on detecting enhanced
                  visuospatial abilities and creative thinking. We
                  used diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter
                  microstructure in neuroanatomical connectivity. The

                  interest-based analyses of the fractional anisotropy
                  (FA), a parameter which is purportedly related to
                  white matter microstructure. In a whole-sample
                  analysis, IQ showed a significant positive
                  correlation with FA, mainly in the corpus callosum,
                  supporting the idea that efficient information
                  transfer between hemispheres is crucial for higher
                  intellectual capabilities. In addition, math-gifted
                  adolescents showed increased FA (adjusted for IQ) in
                  white matter tracts connecting frontal lobes with
                  basal ganglia and parietal regions. The enhanced
                  anatomical connectivity observed in the forceps

                  finding exact solutions are presented in this
                  paper. Huxley equation is an evolution equation that
                  describes the nerve propagation in biology. It is
                  often useful to obtain a generalized solitary
                  solution for fully understanding its physical
                  meanings. It is shown that the solution produced by
                  the Exp-function method may not hold for all initial
                  conditions. It is proven that the analytical
                  condition describing the existence of the produced
                  solution in the space of initial conditions (or even
                  in the space of the system's parameters) can not be
                  derived by the Exp-function method because the
                  question about the existence of that solution is
                  omitted. The proposed operator method, on the
                  contrary, brings the load of symbolic computations
                  before the structure of the solution is
                  identified. The method for the derivation of the
                  solution is based on the concept of the rank of the
                  Hankel matrix constructed from the sequence of
                  coefficients representing formal solution in the
                  series form. Moreover, the structure of the

                  solution's existence. Computational experiments are
                  used to illustrate the properties of derived

                  is generated in vitro in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger
                  complex (pre-B{\"o}tC) by a heterogeneous population
                  of pacemaker neurons coupled by fast excitatory
                  synapses. We prepared thin brain stem slices from
                  neonatal rats that capture the pre-B{\"o}tC and
                  maintain inspiratory-related motor activity in
                  vitro. We recorded pacemaker neurons extracellularly
                  and found: intrinsic bursting behavior that did not
                  depend on Ca2+ currents and persisted after blocking
                  synaptic transmission; multistate behavior with
                  transitions from quiescence to bursting and tonic
                  spiking states as cellular excitability was
                  increased via extracellular K+concentration ([K+]o);
                  a monotonic increase in burst frequency and decrease
                  in burst duration with increasing [K+]o;
                  heterogeneity among different cells sampled; and an
                  increase in inspiratory burst duration and decrease
                  in burst frequency by excitatory synaptic coupling
                  in the respiratory network. These data affirm the
                  basis for the network model, which is composed of
                  heterogeneous pacemaker cells having a
                  voltage-dependent burst-generating mechanism
                  dominated by persistent Na+ current (I NaP) and
                  excitatory synaptic coupling that synchronizes cell
                  activity. We investigated population-level activity
                  in the pre-B{\"o}tC using local ``macropatch''
                  recordings and confirmed these model predictions:
                  pre-B{\"o}tC activity preceded respiratory-related
                  motor output by 100\textendash{}400 ms, consistent
                  with a heterogeneous pacemaker-cell population
                  generating inspiratory rhythm in the pre-B{\"o}tC;
                  pre-B{\"o}tC population burst amplitude decreased
                  monotonically with increasing [K+]o (while frequency
                  increased), which can be attributed to pacemaker
                  cell properties; and burst amplitude fluctuated from
                  cycle to cycle after decreasing bilateral synaptic
                  coupling surgically as predicted from stability
                  analyses of the model. We conclude that the
                  pacemaker cell and network models explain features
                  of inspiratory rhythm generation in vitro.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a class of two-dimensional integrate and
                  fire models has been used to faithfully model
                  spiking neurons. This class includes the Izhikevich
                  model, the adaptive exponential integrate and fire
                  model, and the quartic integrate and fire model. The
                  bifurcation types for the individual neurons have
                  been thoroughly analyzed by Touboul (SIAM J Appl
                  Math 68(4):1045\textendash{}1079, 2008). However,
                  when the models are coupled together to form
                  networks, the networks can display bifurcations that
                  an uncoupled oscillator cannot. For example, the
                  networks can transition from firing with a constant
                  rate to burst firing. This paper introduces a
                  technique to reduce a full network of this class of
                  neurons to a mean field model, in the form of a
                  system of switching ordinary differential
                  equations. The reduction uses population density
                  methods and a quasi-steady state approximation to
                  arrive at the mean field system. Reduced models are
                  derived for networks with different topologies and
                  different model neurons with biologically derived
                  parameters. The mean field equations are able to
                  qualitatively and quantitatively describe the
                  bifurcations that the full networks
                  display. Extensions and higher order approximations

                  medicinal leeches constitutes seven identified pairs
                  of segmental heart interneurons. Four identified
                  pairs of heart interneurons make a staggered pattern
                  of inhibitory synaptic connections with segmental
                  heart motor neurons. Using extracellular recording
                  from multiple interneurons in the network in 56
                  isolated nerve cords, we show that this pattern
                  generator produces a side-to-side asymmetric pattern
                  of intersegmental coordination among ipsilateral
                  premotor interneurons. This pattern corresponds to a
                  similarly asymmetric fictive motor pattern in heart
                  motor neurons and asymmetric constriction pattern of
                  the two tubular hearts, synchronous and
                  peristaltic. We provide a quantitative description
                  of the firing pattern of all the premotor
                  interneurons, including phase, duty cycle, and
                  intraburst frequency of this premotor activity
                  pattern. This analysis identifies two stereotypical
                  coordination modes corresponding to synchronous and
                  peristaltic, which show phase constancy over a broad
                  range of periods as do the fictive motor pattern and
                  the heart constriction pattern. Coordination mode is
                  controlled through one segmental pair of heart
                  interneurons (switch interneurons). Side-to-side
                  switches in coordination mode are a regular feature
                  of this pattern generator and occur with changes in
                  activity state of these switch
                  interneurons. Associated with synchronous

                  circuit coordination. Experiments indicate that
                  spiking and bursting dynamics can be independent. We

                  spiking and a modulational network instability for
                  bursting, are the origin of this independence. We

                  one-dimensional maps that are piecewise smooth and
                  depend on a parameter $\mu$. In the simplest case,
                  there is a point c at which the map has no
                  derivative (it has two one-sided derivatives). The
                  point c is the border of two intervals in which the
                  map is smooth. As the parameter $\mu$ is varied, a
                  fixed point (or periodic point) E$\mu$ may cross the
                  point c, and we may assume that this crossing occurs
                  at $\mu$=0. The investigation of what bifurcations
                  occur at $\mu$=0 reduces to a study of a map f$\mu$
                  depending linearly on $\mu$ and two other parameters
                  a and b. A variety of bifurcations occur frequently
                  in such situations. In particular, E$\mu$ may cross
                  the point c, and for $\mu$$<$0 there can be a fixed
                  point attractor, and for $\mu>$0 there may be a
                  period-3 attractor or even a three-piece chaotic
                  attractor which shrinks to E0 as
                  $\mu\rightarrow$0. More generally, for every integer
                  m$\geq$2, bifurcations from a fixed point attractor
                  to a period-m attractor, a 2m-piece chaotic
                  attractor, an m-piece chaotic attractor, or a
                  one-piece chaotic attractor can occur for piecewise
                  smooth one-dimensional maps. These bifurcations are
                  called border-collision bifurcations. For almost
                  every point in the region of interest in the (a,
                  b)-space, we state explicitly which border-collision
                  bifurcation actually does occur. We believe this
                  phenomenon will be seen in many applications.},

                  dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the
                  apical dendrite and cell soma of MCs to develop a
                  passive compartmental model based on detailed
                  morphological reconstructions of the same
                  cells. Matching the model to traces recorded in
                  experiments we find: C(m) = 1.91 \$$\backslash$pm\$
                  0.20 $\mu$F cm(-2), R(m) = 3547 \$$\backslash$pm\$

                  \$$\backslash$pm\$ 99 $\Omega$ cm. We have
                  constructed a six MC gap-junction (GJ) network model
                  of morphologically accurate MCs. These passive
                  parameters (PPs) were then incorporated into the
                  model with Na(+), Kdr, and KA conductances and GJs
                  from Migliore et al. (2005). The GJs were placed in
                  the apical dendrite tuft (ADT) and their conductance
                  adjusted to give a coupling ratio between MCs
                  consistent with experimental findings (
                  0.04). Firing at 50 Hz was induced in all six MCs
                  with continuous current injections (0.05-0.07 nA) at
                  20 locations to the ADT of two of the MCs. It was
                  found that MCs in the network synchronized better
                  when they shared identical PPs rather than using
                  their own PPs for the fit suggesting that the OB may
                  have populations of MCs tuned for synchrony. The
                  addition of calcium-activated potassium channels
                  (iKCa) and L-type calcium channels (iCa(L)) (Bhalla
                  and Bower, 1993) to the model enabled MCs to
                  generate burst firing. However, the GJ coupling was
                  no longer sufficient to synchronize firing. When
                  cells were stimulated by a continuous current
                  injection there was an initial period of
                  asynchronous burst firing followed after 120 ms by
                  synchronous repetitive firing. This occurred as
                  intracellular calcium fell due to reduced iCa(L)
                  activity. The kinetics of one of the iCa(L) gate
                  variables, which had a long activation time constant
                  ($\tau$ range 18-150 ms), was responsible for this
                  fall in iCa(L). The model makes predictions about
                  the nature of the kinetics of the calcium current
                  that will need experimental verification.},

  abstract     = {Midbrain dopaminergic neurons send numerous
                  projections to cortical and sub-cortical areas, and
                  in a manner dependent upon their activities,
                  diffusely release dopamine (DA) to their
                  targets. Recent experimental studies have shown that
                  DAergic neuronal bursting is associated with a
                  significantly greater degree of DA release than an
                  equivalent tonic activity pattern. Past
                  computational models for DA cell activity relied
                  upon somatodendritic mechanisms in order to generate
                  DA neuronal bursting. However, recent experimental
                  studies indicate that burst firing can be generated
                  somatically with the dendrites silenced. These
                  somatically induced bursts have characteristics
                  consistent with normal bursting, suggesting that a
                  single-compartmental model should be sufficient for
                  generating the observed DA neuronal dynamics. In
                  this work, we introduce such a model for DA neuronal
                  dynamics and demonstrate that this model captures
                  the qualitative behavior of DAergic neuronal
                  dynamics: quiescence, tonic firing and bursting. In
                  our conductance-based approach, the interplay
                  between the L-type calcium and the calcium dependent
                  SK potassium channel provides a scaffold for the
                  underlying oscillation for the pacemaker-like firing
                  patterns. The model includes terms which can
                  selectively block the SK conductance, which would
                  correspond to pharmacological manipulations using
                  the drug apamin. Our modeling studies are in line
                  with experimental evidence that a reduction of the
                  SK conductance often induces DA neuronal
                  bursting. Moreover, our model can reproduce findings
                  that burst firing can be elicited via stimulus
                  driven events, manifested by rises in the amount of
                  NMDA. This model for DA cell activity could be
                  further sculpted to include more detailed second
                  messenger signaling processes in order to elucidate
                  key differences between the two principal classes of
                  midbrain DA neurons: those of the ventral tegmental
                  area and the substantia nigra pars compacta.},

                  tasks: an item recognition task, which can be
                  mediated by a direct-access retrieval process, and a
                  judgment of recency task that requires a serial
                  search. Dissociations were found in the activation
                  patterns in the hippocampus and in the left inferior
                  frontal gyrus (LIFG) when the probe contained the

                  (4\textendash{}8~Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG)
                  oscillations, strengthen the activation of a memory
                  set during short-term memory (STM) retention. In
                  addition, the amplitude of posterior alpha-band
                  (8\textendash{}13~Hz) oscillations during STM
                  retention is thought to reflect a mechanism that
                  protects fragile STM activations from interference
                  by gating bottom-up sensory inputs. The present
                  study addressed two important questions about these
                  phenomena. First, why have previous studies not
                  consistently found memory set-size effects on
                  frontal-midline theta? Second, how does posterior
                  alpha participate in STM retention? To answer these
                  questions, large-scale network connectivity during
                  STM retention was examined by computing EEG wavelet
                  coherence during the retention period of a modified
                  Sternberg task using visually-presented letters as
                  stimuli. The results showed (a) increasing
                  theta-band coherence between frontal-midline and
                  left temporal-parietal sites with increasing memory
                  load, and (b) increasing alpha-band coherence
                  between midline parietal and left temporal/parietal
                  sites with increasing memory load. These findings
                  support the view that theta-band coherence, rather
                  than amplitude, is the key factor in selective
                  top-down strengthening of the memory set and
                  demonstrate that posterior alpha-band oscillations
                  associated with sensory gating are involved in STM
                  retention by participating in the STM network.},

                  the activity of neuronal networks and are required
                  even for their normal operation. The respiratory
                  rhythm generator, localized in the pre-B{\"o}tzinger
                  complex, is not an exception. This network is
                  modulated by various neurotransmitters, including
                  serotonin (5-HT). In this study, we isolated the
                  respiratory network in brainstem slices and
                  demonstrate that the endogenous activation of 5-HT2A
                  is required for the generation of the respiratory
                  rhythm in vitro. At the network level, activation of
                  5-HT2A receptors with
                  4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine or the 5-HT uptake
                  blocker alaproclate increased the frequency of
                  respiratory activity. Blockade of endogenously
                  activated 5-HT2A receptors with three different
                  antagonists decreased the frequency, amplitude, and
                  regularity of respiratory population activity, an
                  effect that was blocked by protein kinase C (PKC)
                  activators. At the cellular level, blockade of
                  5-HT2A receptors reduced the action potential
                  discharge in all examined respiratory neurons, which
                  was associated with a reduction in the fast and the
                  persistent sodium current. Continuous application of
                  5-HT2A-receptor antagonists differentially affected
                  pacemaker neurons. Pacemaker activity was eliminated
                  in cadmium-insensitive pacemaker neurons. In
                  cadmium-sensitive pacemaker neurons, the frequency
                  of pacemaker activity was unaffected and the
                  amplitude of pacemaker bursts was enhanced. It is
                  assumed that cadmium-insensitive pacemakers rely on
                  the persistent sodium current, whereas
                  cadmium-sensitive pacemakers depend on the
                  activation of calcium currents. We conclude that
                  endogenously activated 5-HT2A receptors are required
                  for maintaining fictive respiratory activity in the
                  brainstem slice by modulating sodium conductances
                  via a PKC pathway.},

                  functions have been shown to emerge by theta
                  ($\sim$6~Hz) phase-coupling of distant cortical
                  areas [1,2,3]. It has been repeatedly shown that
                  frontoparietal theta coupling at $\sim$0$^\circ$
                  relative phase is associated with recognition,
                  encoding, short-term retention, and planning
                  [1,4,5]; however, a causal link has not been
                  demonstrated so far. Here we used transcranial
                  alternating current stimulation [6,7,8]
                  simultaneously applied at 6~Hz over left prefrontal
                  and parietal cortices with a relative 0$^\circ$
                  (``synchronized'' condition) or 180$^\circ$
                  (``desynchronized'' condition) phase difference or a
                  placebo stimulation condition, whereas healthy
                  subjects performed a delayed letter discrimination
                  task. We show that exogenously induced
                  frontoparietal theta synchronization significantly
                  improves visual memory-matching reaction times as
                  compared to placebo stimulation. In contrast,
                  exogenously induced frontoparietal theta
                  desynchronization deteriorates performance. The
                  present findings provide for the first time evidence
                  of causality of theta phase-coupling of distant
                  cortical areas for cognitive performance in healthy
                  humans. Moreover, the results demonstrate the
                  suitability of transcranial alternating current
                  stimulation to artificially induce coupling or
                  decoupling of behaviorally relevant brain rhythms

                  embryonic neurons in an isolated, but intact spinal
                  cord. Whole cell recordings were done at external
                  calcium concentrations of 1 mM. NMDA alone
                  (50\textendash{}200 $\mu$M) or in association with
                  10 $\mu$M serotonin or glycine induced oscillatory
                  activity in most presumed motoneurons, which were
                  therefore considered part of rhythm generating
                  networks. In the presence of TTX, one-half of these
                  neurons maintained this activity. The oscillations
                  fell into two main categories: voltage-dependent,
                  low-frequency (0.3\textendash{}0.5 Hz) and

                  oscillations in one-third of the neurons; however,
                  the percentage of neurons showing oscillations was
                  greater in the presence of exogenous
                  5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or glycine. Because these
                  observations were made at embryonic stages where
                  little or no serotonergic innervation exists, it is
                  likely that NMDA-induced intrinsic oscillatory

  abstract     = {The pre-Botzinger complex (pBC) is a vital
                  subcircuit of the respiratory central pattern
                  generator. Although the existence of neurons with
                  pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network
                  is not questioned, their role in network
                  rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally
                  suited to address this debate because of the ease
                  with which biophysical parameters of individual
                  cells and network architecture can be
                  manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of
                  experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and
                  nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our
                  previously developed pBC neuron and network
                  models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in
                  networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of
                  these neurons and varied the fraction of the
                  population made up of pacemakers. For each number of
                  pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic
                  drive to the network and measured the frequency of
                  synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both
                  excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and
                  sparsely connected networks were explored for
                  several levels of synaptic coupling
                  strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers
                  were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with
                  a low probability of bursting and low input and
                  output ranges. Our results indicate that inclusion
                  of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases
                  robustness of the network by more than tripling the
                  input and output ranges compared with networks
                  containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in
                  dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers
                  in the network is greater than 20\% of the
                  population. Experimental tests of our model
                  predictions are proposed.},

                  functions has a history of success over the last
                  half century. This includes, for example, the
                  explanation and prediction of some features of
                  neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting
                  dynamical models of learning and memory based on
                  physiological experiments have been suggested over
                  the last two decades. Dynamical models even of
                  consciousness now exist. Usually these models and
                  results are based on traditional approaches and
                  paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical
                  chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual
                  subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons:
                  (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a
                  few neurons and synaptic connections, has an
                  enormous number of variables and control
                  parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and
                  flexible, and are critical to their biological
                  function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical
                  systems described by well-known basic principles,
                  first principles governing the dynamics of neural
                  systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural
                  systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having
                  different architectures and different levels of
                  complexity. (iv) The network architecture and
                  connection strengths are usually not known in detail
                  and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some
                  sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems
                  are able to organize behavior based on sensory
                  inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has
                  to explain the transformation of temporal
                  information into combinatorial or
                  combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for
                  memory and recognition. In this review these
                  problems are discussed in the context of addressing
                  the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience
                  learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can
                  nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

                  interaction between synaptic and membrane properties
                  of functionally defined neurons. To gain a better
                  understanding of how inhibitory and excitatory
                  synaptic inputs lead to the generation of the
                  respiratory rhythm we analyzed the depolarization
                  pattern of respiratory neurons that were recorded in
                  the transverse slice preparation of mice
                  (P8\textendash{}22) and the in vivo adult cat. Using
                  voltage-clamp recordings from respiratory neurons
                  and specific antagonists for inhibitory synaptic
                  transmission we demonstrate under in vitro
                  conditions, that inspiratory (n=7) and
                  post-inspiratory neurons (n=13) received concurrent
                  glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic input during
                  inspiration. A similar conclusion was gained with
                  chloride injections into in vivo respiratory
                  neurons. The inhibitory input was essential not only
                  for generating the characteristic depolarization
                  pattern of respiratory neurons, but also for
                  switching the respiratory rhythm between inspiration
                  and post-inspiration. The generation of the
                  depolarization pattern depends also on intrinsic
                  membrane properties. Negative current injections
                  reveal that excitatory synaptic input was amplified
                  by intrinsic bursting properties in some inspiratory
                  neurons (n=4) recorded in vitro. Although such
                  properties have not been described under in vivo
                  conditions our findings suggest that with respect to
                  inspiratory, post-inspiratory and late-inspiratory
                  neurons, the principle network organization is

                  involving areas in the neocortex, cerebellum, pons,
                  medulla, spinal cord, and various other subcortical
                  regions. However, only one area seems to be
                  essential and sufficient for generating the
                  respiratory rhythm: the preB{\"o}tzinger complex
                  (preB{\"o}tC). Lesioning this area abolishes
                  breathing and following isolation in a brain slice
                  the preB{\"o}tC continues to generate different
                  forms of respiratory activities. The use of slice
                  preparations led to a thorough understanding of the
                  cellular mechanisms that underlie the generation of
                  inspiratory activity within this network. Two types
                  of inward currents, the persistent sodium current
                  (INaP) and the calcium-activated non-specific cation
                  current (ICAN), play important roles in respiratory
                  rhythm generation. These currents give rise to
                  autonomous pacemaker activity within respiratory
                  neurons, leading to the generation of intrinsic
                  spiking and bursting activity. These membrane
                  properties amplify as well as activate synaptic
                  mechanisms that are critical for the initiation and
                  maintenance of inspiratory activity. In this review,
                  we describe the dynamic interplay between synaptic
                  and intrinsic membrane properties in the generation
                  of the respiratory rhythm and we relate these

                  activation of stable neuronal assemblies,
                  i.e. distributed groups of co-active neurons within
                  neuronal networks. It is therefore crucial to
                  monitor distributed patterns of activity in real
                  time with single-neuron resolution. Microelectrode
                  recordings allow detection of coincidence between
                  discharges of identified units at high temporal
                  resolution, but are not able to reveal the full
                  spatial pattern of activity in multi-cellular
                  assemblies. Therefore, observation of such
                  distributed sets of neurons is a stronghold of
                  optical techniques, but the required resolution,
                  sensitivity, and speed are still challenging current
                  technology. Here, we report a new approach for
                  monitoring neuronal assemblies, using memory-related
                  network oscillations in rodent hippocampal circuits
                  as a model. The cytosolic calcium-sensitive
                  fluorescent protein GCaMP3.NES was expressed using
                  recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV)-mediated
                  gene transfer in CA3 pyramidal neurons of cultured
                  mouse hippocampal slices. After 14\textendash{}21
                  days in culture, field potential recordings revealed
                  spontaneous occurrence of sharp wave-ripple network
                  events during which a fraction of local neurons is
                  coherently activated. Using a custom-built
                  epi-fluorescence microscope we could monitor a field
                  of view of 410 $\mu$m \texttimes{} 410 $\mu$m with
                  single-neuron optical resolution (20 \texttimes{}
                  objective, 0.4 NA). We developed a highly sensitive
                  and specific wavelet-based method of cell
                  identification allowing simultaneous observation of
                  more than 150 neurons at frame rates of up to 60

                  potential oscillations following the coactivation of
                  N-methyl-dl-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine
                  (serotonin or 5-HT) receptors (

                  ;Eur. J. Neurosci., 9, 1473\textendash{}1482). The
                  oscillations are slow ($\approx$0.5 Hz) compared
                  with swimming ($\approx$7\textendash{}35 Hz) raising
                  doubt over their contribution to the cycle by cycle
                  depolarizations occurring during swimming. We
                  investigated an alternative: that the intrinsic
                  oscillations modulate swimming activity over many
                  consecutive cycles. Bath application of NMDA induced
                  continuous fictive swimming that differed between
                  embryonic and larval preparations. In 81\% of larval
                  preparations (n = 36), there was a slow
                  (approximately every 2 s) rhythmic modulation of
                  ventral root activity in which burst durations and
                  intensities increased as cycle periods
                  decreased. This pattern of activity was enhanced
                  rather than abolished following blockade of glycine
                  and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors
                  and presumably therefore resulted from a periodic
                  increase in the excitation of motor neurons. To
                  determine whether this slow rhythm resulted from
                  intrinsic, 5-HT-dependent membrane potential
                  oscillations, larvae were spinalized to prevent the
                  release of 5-HT from brainstem raphe neurons. The
                  resulting pattern of NMDA-induced activity lacked
                  any slow modulation. The slow modulation could also
                  be enhanced by the bath application of a 5-HT
                  receptor agonist (5-carboxamidotryptamine) and
                  abolished either by the addition of an antagonist
                  (pindobind-5-HT1A) or by removal of magnesium ions,
                  providing more direct evidence for a contribution of
                  intrinsic oscillations. Thus, the 5-HT-dependent
                  intrinsic oscillations modulate NMDA-induced
                  swimming activity over several consecutive cycles.},

                  importance to the understanding of neural
                  coding. Recent studies have demonstrated,
                  theoretically and experimentally, that neural
                  pacemakers produce chaotic oscillations. Deeper
                  analyses in several neuronal models have revealed
                  many nonlinear phenomena including period-adding
                  bifurcations whose existence has not been

                  reported that the period-adding bifurcation with
                  chaos was observed in the interspike interval (ISI)
                  series generated by an experimental neural pacemaker
                  when the extracellular calcium concentration was
                  changed or a potassium channel blocker was
                  administered at the site of the pacemaker. We also
                  simulated our experimental discoveries by computing
                  a generalized model of excitable cells. The chaotic
                  phenomenon in the experiment and that in the model

  abstract     = {Developmentally regulated action potentials are a
                  hallmark of Rohon- Beard cells, a class of sensory
                  neurons. In these neurons as well as other primary
                  spinal neurons of Xenopus laevis, the functional
                  differentiation of delayed-rectifier potassium
                  current regulates the waveform of the action
                  potential during the initial day of its
                  appearance. Later, the acquisition of another
                  voltage-dependent potassium current--the A
                  current--plays a major role in regulating
                  excitability. In order to understand the molecular
                  basis of this functional differentiation, genes
                  encoding voltage-dependent potassium currents
                  expressed in the embryonic amphibian nervous system
                  are being cloned. Here, we report the functional
                  properties and developmental localization of a
                  second Xenopus Shaker-like gene (Xenopus Kv 1.1;
                  XSha1; GenBank accession number M94258) encoding a
                  potassium current. Homology screening with the mouse
                  gene MBK1 led to its isolation. Functional
                  expression in oocytes identifies it as a
                  delayed-rectifier current when assembled as a
                  homooligomeric structure. Specific transcripts
                  corresponding to XSha1 and to the previously cloned
                  gene XSha2 are both detectable by RNase protection
                  in RNA isolated from the embryonic nervous
                  system. However, whole-mount in situ hybridization
                  reveals the temporal pattern and cellular
                  localization of XSha1 but not XSha2 mRNA, suggesting
                  that the concentration of XSha2 transcripts in
                  individual cells is lower than the threshold for
                  detection by this method. Of particular interest,
                  Rohon-Beard cells express XSha1 mRNA. In addition,
                  XSha1 mRNA is detected in several structures
                  containing neural crest derivatives including spinal
                  ganglia, the trigeminal ganglion, and branchial
                  arches; its presence in motor nerves and lateral
                  spinal tracts suggests that both CNS and PNS glia
                  express the mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

                  are known to correlate cross-sectionally with
                  cognitive ability measures, but only a few small
                  studies have tested for longitudinal relations among
                  these variables. We tested whether there were
                  coupled changes in brain white matter microstructure
                  indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and three
                  broad cognitive domains (fluid intelligence,

                  human participants with longitudinal diffusion

  abstract     = {Embryos spinalized at the 3rd to 6th postotic
                  myotome and immobilized in 10(-4) M tubocurarine can
                  respond to a brief skin stimulus with motor root
                  activity suitable for swimming. Embryos spinalized
                  at the more caudal levels give shorter episodes of
                  fictive swimming. We have previously described the
                  synaptic inputs to motoneurons during fictive
                  swimming in intact embryos (23). In the present
                  paper we look to see if similar synaptic inputs are
                  present in spinal embryos and are therefore spinal
                  in origin. All motoneuron firing during fictive
                  swimming is associated with a tonic depolarization
                  that falls away slowly once firing stops, is
                  increased by hyperpolarizing current, and is reduced
                  by depolarizing current. A slow depolarizing
                  potential evoked by lower levels of skin stimulation
                  has similar properties and rate of fall. In 1-2 mM
                  PDA, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, only a
                  small remnant of the depolarization remains, and
                  motoneuron firing stops. The NMDA antagonist 50
                  microM APV reduces the depolarization less but also
                  blocks firing. Motoneurons fire one spike per
                  swimming cycle, in phase with nearby motor root
                  discharge. Spikes are preceded by a depolarizing
                  prepotential. This increases with hyperpolarizing
                  current, which can block the spike to reveal an
                  underlying depolarizing potential. In phase with
                  motor root discharge on the opposite side of the
                  body, motoneurons receive a midcycle inhibitory
                  postsynaptic potential, which increases with
                  depolarizing current, decreases with hyperpolarizing
                  current, and is blocked by 10(-6) M
                  strychnine. Strychnine, 5 X 10(-7) M, leads first to
                  broadening of motor root bursts then to loss of the
                  alternating swimming pattern of activity, which is
                  replaced by synchronous bursts on both sides of the
                  body. We conclude that the synaptic inputs to

                  understanding how they produce behavior remains a
                  real challenge. We chose to study hatchling Xenopus
                  tadpoles where behavior is controlled by a few
                  thousand neurons but there is a very limited number
                  of types of neuron. Young tadpoles can flex, swim
                  away, adjust their trajectory, speed-up and
                  slow-down, stop when they contact support and
                  struggle when grasped. They are sensitive to touch,
                  pressure, noxious stimuli, light intensity and water
                  currents. Using whole-cell recording has led to
                  rapid progress in understanding central networks
                  controlling behavior. Our methods are illustrated by
                  an analysis of the flexion reflex to skin touch. We
                  then define the seven types of neuron that allow the
                  tadpole to swim when the skin is touched and use
                  paired recordings to investigate neuron properties,
                  synaptic connections and activity
                  patterns. Proposals on how the swim network operates
                  are evaluated by experiment and network modeling. We
                  then examine GABAergic inhibitory pathways that
                  control swimming but also produce tonic inhibition
                  to reduce responsiveness when the tadpole is at
                  rest. Finally, we analyze the strong alternating
                  struggling movements the tadpole makes when
                  grasped. We show that the mechanisms for rhythm
                  generation here are very different to those during
                  swimming. Although much remains to be explained,
                  study of this simple vertebrate has uncovered basic
                  principles about the function and organization of
                  vertebrate nervous systems.},

  abstract     = {How do the pioneer networks in the axial core of the
                  vertebrate nervous system first develop? Fundamental
                  to understanding any full-scale neuronal network is
                  knowledge of the constituent neurons, their
                  properties, synaptic interconnections, and normal
                  activity. Our novel strategy uses basic
                  developmental rules to generate model networks that
                  retain individual neuron and synapse resolution and
                  are capable of reproducing correct, whole animal
                  responses. We apply our developmental strategy to
                  young Xenopus tadpoles, whose brainstem and spinal
                  cord share a core vertebrate plan, but at a
                  tractable complexity. Following detailed anatomical
                  and physiological measurements to complete a
                  descriptive library of each type of spinal neuron,
                  we build models of their axon growth controlled by
                  simple chemical gradients and physical barriers. By
                  adding dendrites and allowing probabilistic
                  formation of synaptic connections, we reconstruct
                  network connectivity among up to 2000 neurons. When
                  the resulting "network" is populated by model
                  neurons and synapses, with properties based on
                  physiology, it can respond to sensory stimulation by
                  mimicking tadpole swimming behavior. This
                  functioning model represents the most complete
                  reconstruction of a vertebrate neuronal network that
                  can reproduce the complex, rhythmic behavior of a
                  whole animal. The findings validate our novel
                  developmental strategy for generating realistic
                  networks with individual neuron- and synapse-level
                  resolution. We use it to demonstrate how early
                  functional neuronal connectivity and behavior may in
                  life result from simple developmental "rules," which
                  lay out a scaffold for the vertebrate CNS without

                  appear on a background of reduced fluid
                  intelligence, best measured with tests of novel
                  problem solving. For a range of specific executive
                  tests, we ask how far frontal deficits can be
                  explained by a general fluid intelligence loss. For
                  some widely used tests, e.g. Wisconsin Card Sorting,
                  we find that fluid intelligence entirely explains
                  frontal deficits. When patients and controls are
                  matched on fluid intelligence, no further frontal
                  deficit remains. For these tasks too, deficits are
                  unrelated to lesion location within the frontal
                  lobe. A second group of tasks, including tests of
                  both cognitive (e.g. Hotel, Proverbs) and social
                  (Faux Pas) function, shows a different
                  pattern. Deficits are not fully explained by fluid
                  intelligence and the data suggest association with
                  lesions in the right anterior frontal
                  cortex. Understanding of frontal lobe deficits may
                  be clarified by separating reduced fluid
                  intelligence, important in most or all tasks, from
                  other more specific impairments and their associated
                  regions of damage.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical modeling with delay differential
                  equations (DDEs) is widely used in various
                  application areas of science and engineering (e.g.,
                  in semiconductor lasers with delayed feedback,
                  high-speed machining, communication networks, and
                  control systems) and in the life sciences (e.g., in
                  population dynamics, epidemiology, immunology, and
                  physiology). Delay equations have an
                  infinite-dimensional state space because their
                  solution is unique only when an initial function is
                  specified on a time interval of length equal to the
                  largest delay. Consequently, analytical calculations
                  are more difficult than for ordinary differential
                  equations and numerical methods are generally the
                  only way to achieve a complete analysis, prediction
                  and control of systems with time delays. Delay
                  differential equations are a special type of
                  functional differential equation (FDE). In FDEs the
                  time evolution of the state variable can depend on
                  the past in an arbitrary way as long as the
                  dependence is a bounded function of the
                  past. However, DDEs impose a constraint on this
                  dependence, namely that the evolution depends only
                  on certain past values of the state at discrete
                  times. (We do not consider here the case of
                  distributed delay.) The delays can be constant or
                  state dependent. The equations can also involve
                  delayed values of the derivative of the state, which
                  leads to equations of neutral type.},

                  and in general the neuron with the lower firing rate
                  stops spiking for strong enough inhibitory coupling,
                  while the faster neuron remains active. However, in
                  scenario (ii) the originally slower neuron stops
                  spiking at weaker inhibitory coupling strength,
                  suggesting that the electrical coupling introduces
                  an element of instability to the two-neuron

                  thought to raise the excitation level of each neuron
                  or, if they are both bursty, to act to synchronize
                  their bursts. If only one is bursty, it can induce
                  synchronized bursts in the other cell. Here we show
                  that two nonbursty cells can be induced to burst in
                  synchrony by mutual excitatory synaptic connections,

                  and then discuss how geometric singular perturbation
                  methods have been used to analyze these rhythms. We
                  begin by discussing models for single cells which
                  display bursting oscillations. There are, in fact,
                  several different classes of bursting solutions;
                  these have been classified by the geometric
                  properties of how solutions evolve in phase
                  space. We describe several of the bursting classes
                  and then review related rigorous mathematical
                  analysis. We then discuss the dynamics of small
                  networks of neurons. We are primarily interested in
                  whether excitatory or inhibitory synaptic coupling
                  leads to either synchronous or desynchronous
                  rhythms. We demonstrate that all four combinations
                  are possible, depending on the details of the
                  intrinsic and synaptic properties of the
                  cells. Finally, we discuss larger networks of
                  neuronal oscillators involving two distinct cell
                  populations. In particular, we demonstrate how
                  dynamical systems methods can be used to analyze
                  recent models for sleep rhythms and other
                  oscillations generated in the thalamus. The analysis
                  helps to explain the generation of the different
                  thalamic rhythms and the transitions between them,
                  in both of which inhibition plays a crucial role.},

                  leads to bursting in the resulting two-cell

                  oscillators, in that they can be tuned to engage in
                  relaxation oscillations, or when they are

                  neural-motor rhythms that often depend on
                  specialized cellular or synaptic properties such as
                  pacemaker neurons or alternating phases of synaptic
                  inhibition. Motivated by experimental evidence
                  suggesting that activity in the mammalian
                  respiratory CPG, the preB{\"o}tzinger complex, does
                  not require either of these components, we present
                  and analyze a mathematical model demonstrating an
                  unconventional mechanism of rhythm generation in
                  which glutamatergic synapses and the short-term
                  depression of excitatory transmission play key
                  rhythmogenic roles. Recurrent synaptic excitation
                  triggers postsynaptic Ca2+-activated nonspecific
                  cation current (ICAN) to initiate a network-wide
                  burst. Robust depolarization due to ICAN also causes
                  voltage-dependent spike inactivation, which
                  diminishes recurrent excitation and thus attenuates
                  postsynaptic Ca2+ accumulation. Consequently,
                  activity-dependent outward
                  currents\textemdash{}produced by Na/K ATPase pumps
                  or other ionic mechanisms\textemdash{}can terminate
                  the burst and cause a transient quiescent state in
                  the network. The recovery of sporadic spiking
                  activity rekindles excitatory interactions and
                  initiates a new cycle. Because synaptic inputs gate
                  postsynaptic burst-generating conductances, this
                  rhythm-generating mechanism represents a new
                  paradigm that can be dubbed a `group pacemaker' in
                  which the basic rhythmogenic unit encompasses a
                  fully interdependent ensemble of synaptic and
                  intrinsic components. This conceptual framework
                  should be considered as an alternative to
                  traditional models when analyzing CPGs for which

                  or pre-inspiratory) oscillations emerge in abdominal
                  motor output with increasing metabolic demands
                  (e.g., during hypercapnia, hypoxia, etc.). These
                  oscillations originate in the retrotrapezoid
                  nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) and
                  couple with the respiratory oscillations generated
                  by the interacting neural populations of the
                  B{\"o}tzinger (B{\"o}tC) and pre-B{\"o}tzinger
                  (pre-B{\"o}tC) complexes, representing the kernel of
                  the respiratory central pattern generator. Recently,
                  we analyzed experimental data on the generation of
                  late-E oscillations and proposed a large-scale
                  computational model that simulates the possible
                  interactions between the B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC and
                  RTN/pFRG oscillations under different
                  conditions. Here we describe a reduced model that
                  maintains the essential features and architecture of
                  the large-scale model, but relies on simplified
                  activity-based descriptions of neural
                  populations. This simplification allowed us to use
                  methods of dynamical systems theory, such as
                  fast-slow decomposition, bifurcation analysis, and
                  phase plane analysis, to elucidate the mechanisms
                  and dynamics of synchronization between the RTN/pFRG
                  and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations. Three
                  physiologically relevant behaviors have been
                  analyzed: emergence and quantal acceleration of
                  late-E oscillations during hypercapnia,
                  transformation of the late-E activity into a
                  biphasic-E activity during hypercapnic hypoxia, and
                  quantal slowing of B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC
                  oscillations with the reduction of pre-B{\"o}tC
                  excitability. Each behavior is elicited by gradual
                  changes in excitatory drives or other model
                  parameters, reflecting specific changes in metabolic
                  and/or physiological conditions. Our results provide
                  important theoretical insights into interactions
                  between RTN/pFRG and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC
                  oscillations and the role of these interactions in

                  of a new phenomenological model of a neuron capable
                  of replicating important spike pattern
                  characteristics and designed in the form of a system
                  of difference equations (a map). We developed a set
                  of map-based models that replicate spiking activity
                  of cortical fast spiking, regular spiking and
                  intrinsically bursting neurons. Interconnected with
                  synaptic currents these model neurons demonstrated
                  responses very similar to those found with

  abstract     = {The mammalian spinal cord contains a locomotor
                  central pattern generator (CPG) that can produce
                  alternating rhythmic activity of flexor and extensor
                  motoneurones in the absence of rhythmic input and
                  proprioceptive feedback. During such fictive
                  locomotor activity in decerebrate cats, spontaneous
                  omissions of activity occur simultaneously in
                  multiple agonist motoneurone pools for a number of
                  cycles. During these `deletions', antagonist
                  motoneurone pools usually become tonically active
                  but may also continue to be rhythmic. The rhythmic
                  activity that re-emerges following a deletion is
                  often not phase shifted. This suggests that some
                  neuronal mechanism can maintain the locomotor period
                  when motoneurone activity fails. To account for
                  these observations, a simplified computational model
                  of the spinal circuitry has been developed in which
                  the locomotor CPG consists of two levels: a
                  half-centre rhythm generator (RG) and a pattern
                  formation (PF) network, with reciprocal inhibitory
                  interactions between antagonist neural populations
                  at each level. The model represents a network of
                  interacting neural populations with single
                  interneurones and motoneurones described in the
                  Hodgkin-Huxley style. The model reproduces the range
                  of locomotor periods and phase durations observed
                  during real locomotion in adult cats and permits
                  independent control of the level of motoneurone
                  activity and of step cycle timing. By altering the
                  excitability of neural populations within the PF
                  network, the model can reproduce deletions in which
                  motoneurone activity fails but the phase of
                  locomotor oscillations is maintained. The model also
                  suggests criteria for the functional identification
                  of spinal interneurones involved in the mammalian
                  locomotor pattern generation.},

                  the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch
                  pad are well explored. In contrast, less is known
                  about central executive processes. Neuroimaging
                  studies suggest that central executive processes are
                  related to a complex fronto-parietal network. In the
                  present study we investigate the question whether
                  varying demands on central executive processes are
                  reflected by differences in coherent activity
                  between and within a fronto-parietal network. We
                  calculated coherence during a visuospatial working

                  condition, subjects had to mentally manipulate these
                  patterns. The results indicate the involvement of
                  prefrontal areas in executive functions reflected by
                  a decrease of anterior upper alpha short-range

                  Hz) while subjects executed complex sequential
                  finger movements with varying task difficulty and
                  memory load. Local frontal-midline theta activity
                  was associated with the general level of cognitive
                  demand, with the highest amplitudes in the most
                  demanding condition. Using low-resolution
                  electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA), this
                  theta activity was localized in the anterior
                  cingulate gyrus including the cingulate motor
                  area. These results suggest that local theta
                  activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus represents
                  correlates of an attentional system that allocate
                  cognitive resources. In addition, interregional

                  (1) NMDA receptor activation occurs during locomotor
                  network operation in lower and higher vertebrates
                  and (2) NMDA induces active membrane properties that
                  can be expressed as intrinsic voltage fluctuations
                  in cells located in the spinal cord of lower
                  vertebrates, as well as in neurons located in
                  supraspinal regions of the mammalian nervous
                  system. This paper reviews recent data showing that
                  NMDA can induce similiar inherent membrane potential
                  behavior in synaptically isolated motoneurons and
                  interneurons in the mammalian (in vitro neonatal
                  rat) spinal cord. These TTX-resistant voltage
                  fluctuations include rhythmic oscillations and
                  plateau potentials, as well as low-frequency
                  long-lasting voltage shifts (LLVSs). 5-HT
                  facilitates the transformation of LLVSs into
                  oscillatory events, and 5-HT receptor antagonists
                  have the reverse effect. In the absence of TTX,
                  locomotor-related rhythmic drive potentials in
                  spinal cord neurons can display nonlinear voltage
                  behavior compatible with NMDA receptor activation,
                  although other voltage-activated conductances are
                  not excluded. Suppression of the nonlinear voltage
                  response associated with NMDA receptor activation,
                  via removal of Mg2+, disrupts locomotor patterns of
                  network activity. The potential role of NMDA
                  receptor activation in the operation of mammalian
                  locomotor networks is discussed in the context of
                  these recent observations.},

  abstract     = {Neurons produce complex patterns of electrical
                  spikes, which are often clustered in bursts. The
                  patterns of spikes and bursts can change
                  substantially when neurons are exposed to toxins and
                  chemical agents. For that reason, characterization
                  of these patterns is important for the development
                  of neuron-based biosensors for environmental threat
                  exposure. Here, we develop a quantitative approach
                  to describe the distribution of interspike
                  intervals, based on plotting histograms of the
                  logarithm of the interspike interval. This approach
                  provides a method for automatically classifying
                  spikes into bursts, which does not depend on
                  assumptions about the burst parameters. Furthermore,
                  the approach provides a sensitive technique for
                  detecting changes in spike and burst patterns
                  induced by pharmacological exposure. Hence, it is
                  suitable for use both as a research tool and for
                  deployment in a neuron-based biosensor.},

                  use a simplified model for pancreatic $\beta$-cells
                  and decompose the system into fast
                  (spike-generating) and slow subsystems to show how
                  bifurcations of the fast subsystem affect bursting
                  behavior. When coupling is weak, the spikes are not
                  in phase but rather are anti-phase, asymmetric or
                  quasi-periodic. These solutions all support bursting
                  with smaller amplitude spikes than the in-phase
                  case, leading to increased burst period. A key
                  geometrical feature underlying this is that the
                  in-phase periodic solution branch terminates in a
                  homoclinic orbit. The same mechanism also provides a
                  model for bursting as an emergent property of

                  can burst when coupled. This phenomenon is enhanced
                  when symmetry is broken by making the cells differ

                  rhythmically active during fictive swimming and
                  presumed to be motoneurons. Resting potentials and
                  input resistances of such neurons are -75
                  \$$\backslash$pm\$ 2 mV (mean \$$\backslash$pm\$
                  standard error) and 118 \$$\backslash$pm\$ 17
                  M$\Omega$ respectively. Most cells fire a single
                  impulse, 0.5 to 2.0 ms in duration and 48.5
                  \$$\backslash$pm\$ 1.8 mV in amplitude, in response
                  to a depolarizing current step. A minority fire
                  several spikes of diminishing amplitude to more
                  strongly depolarizing current. Cells held above
                  spike, threshold fire on rebound from brief
                  hyperpolarizing pulses. Spikes are blocked by 0.1 to
                  1.0 $\mu$M tetrodotoxin (TTX) and are therefore
                  Na+-dependent. Current/voltage (I/V) plots to
                  injected current are approximately linear near the
                  resting potential but become non-linear at more
                  depolarized levels. Cells recorded in TTX with
                  CsCl-filled microelectrodes show a linearized I/V
                  plot at depolarized membrane potentials suggesting
                  the normal presence of a voltage-dependent K+
                  conductance activated at relatively depolarized
                  levels. Most cells recorded in this way but without
                  TTX fire long trains of spikes of near constant
                  amplitude, pointing to a role of the K+ conductance
                  in limiting firing in normal cells. Spike blockage
                  with TTX reveals, in some cells, a transient
                  depolarizing Cd2+-sensitive and therefore presumably
                  Ca2+-dependent potential that increases in amplitude
                  with depolarization. Cells in TTX, Cd2+, and
                  strychnine, and recorded with CsCl-filled
                  microelectrodes to block active conductances respond
                  to hyperpolarizing current steps with a two
                  component exponential response. The cell time
                  constant ($\tau$0) obtained from the longer of these
                  by exponential peeling is relatively long (mean 15.7
                  ms). These findings contribute to an increased
                  understanding of the cellular properties involved in
                  spinal rhythm generation in this simple vertebrate.},

  abstract     = {Xenopus embryos show two distinct rhythmic motor
                  patterns: swimming and struggling. Both can be
                  generated by spinal cord circuitry and evoked by
                  stimulation of a single skin sensory pathway (Soffe,
                  1991b). This presents a valuable opportunity to
                  explore mechanisms for vertebrate motor pattern
                  switching. Swimming and struggling have been
                  compared using intracellular recording from spinal
                  neurons in immobilized embryos. Underlying synaptic
                  drive was similar; motoneurons and premotor
                  interneurons were excited in phase with ipsilateral
                  motor root discharge and inhibited in phase with
                  contralateral motor root discharge. Excitation was
                  stronger during struggling and associated with short
                  bursts of impulses, contrasting with single spikes
                  per cycle during swimming. Excitation was reduced in
                  both patterns by local application of 1 mM kynurenic
                  acid, indicating excitatory amino acid
                  mediation. Inhibition was antagonized by 1 microM
                  strychnine, indicating glycine mediation. Many
                  motoneurons (76\%) and premotor interneurons (68\%)
                  fired during both swimming and struggling, including
                  examples of all three spinal premotor interneuron
                  classes. Most of the remaining motoneurons (20\%)
                  and premotor interneurons (24\%) fired only during
                  struggling, providing roughly 30\% more active
                  neurons than during swimming. To investigate whether
                  new neuronal classes become active during
                  struggling, recordings were made from sensory
                  neurons and sensory interneurons. Rohon-Beard
                  sensory neurons did not fire during either swimming
                  or struggling. Dorsolateral commissural sensory
                  interneurons received rhythmic, strychnine-sensitive
                  inhibition during both swimming and struggling and
                  also did not fire. Neither of these neuronal classes
                  is therefore recruited to the circuitry for
                  struggling. Although behaviorally distinct, Xenopus
                  embryo swimming and struggling motor patterns appear
                  to employ similar synaptic drive. I propose that
                  this reflects the common nature of much of the
                  premotor circuitry that drives them. Extra neurons
                  are recruited to this circuitry during struggling,
                  but only from within classes that also participate
                  in swimming.},

                  understood. Immobilized, spinal Xenopus embryos are
                  used here to examine the motor patterns evoked by
                  various concentrations of excitatory amino
                  acids. 2. Relatively low concentrations of
                  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (40-60 microM), kainate
                  (7-8 microM), and
                  alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
                  (AMPA) (5 microM) evoked motor root discharge
                  characteristic of swimming. Brief applications of
                  higher concentrations of kainate (20-40 microM),
                  AMPA (25-30 microM), quisqualate (5 microM), and
                  glutamate (1-4 mM) evoked sequences of a different
                  motor pattern: struggling. This is characterized by
                  a longer cycle period, increased burst duration, and
                  a reversed longitudinal pattern of motor root
                  discharge. The struggling pattern was never evoked
                  by higher concentrations of NMDA (300-500 microM),
                  but was evoked by 30 microM AMPA or 5 microM
                  quisqualate in the presence of 50 microM
                  D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic
                  acid. 3. Intracellular recordings from presumed
                  spinal motoneurons showed different patterns of
                  activity during agonist-evoked swimming and
                  struggling. The patterns were like those described
                  previously during sensory-evoked behavior. 4. Caudal
                  applications of excitatory amino acids that produced
                  struggling discharge did so only at caudal motor
                  roots, whereas caudal applications of NMDA evoked
                  swimming activity throughout the spinal
                  cord. 5. During excitatory-amino-acid-evoked
                  struggling, sensory Rohon-Beard neurons depolarized
                  up to 7 mV, but did not fire. 6. The results show
                  that expression of the struggling pattern, like
                  swimming, is not critically dependent on sensory
                  discharge. The results are also consistent with the
                  idea that expression of the two very different motor
                  patterns for swimming or struggling in this simple
                  vertebrate preparation can be controlled by the
                  level of excitation within the spinal motor
                  circuitry, and need not involve the activity of a
                  specific external neuromodulator.},

                  firing activities of neural system and plays an
                  important role in signal encoding and
                  transmission. In the present paper, a neural network
                  with delay coupling is modeled to investigate the
                  generation mechanism of bursting behavior. The
                  Andronov-Hopf bifurcation is firstly studied and
                  then the degenerated Andronov-Hopf bifurcation,
                  namely Bautin bifurcation, is analyzed with the
                  external input varying. Classifying dynamics in the
                  neighborhood of the Bautin bifurcation, we obtain
                  the bifurcation sets where the
                  supercritical/subcritical Andronov-Hopf, or the fold
                  limit cycle bifurcation may happen in the system
                  under consideration. For a periodic disturbance
                  occurring in the neighborhood of the Bautin
                  bifurcation, it is seen that the Andronov-Hopf
                  bifurcation and fold limit cycle bifurcation may
                  lead to the transition from quiescent state to
                  firing activities. Complex bursting phenomena,
                  including Hopf/Hopf bursting, Hopf/Fold cycle
                  bursting, SubHopf/Hopf bursting and SubHopf/Fold
                  cycle bursting are found in the firing area. The
                  results show that the dynamical properties of
                  different burstings are related to the dynamical
                  behaviors derived from the bifurcations of the
                  system. Finally, it is seen that the bursting
                  disappears but the periodic spiking appears in the
                  delayed neural network for large values of delay.},

                  realistic depiction of neuronal activity, their
                  complexity often limits effective implementation and
                  analysis. Neuronal model reduction methods provide a
                  means to reduce model complexity while retaining the
                  original model's realism and relevance. Such
                  methods, however, typically include ad hoc
                  components that require that the modeler already be
                  intimately familiar with the dynamics of the
                  original model. We present an automated, algorithmic
                  method for reducing conductance-based neuron models
                  using the method of equivalent potentials (Kelper et
                  al., Biol Cybern 66(5):381\textendash{}387, 1992)
                  Our results demonstrate that this algorithm is able
                  to reduce the complexity of the original model with

  abstract     = {Neural models are increasingly being used as design
                  components of physical systems. In order to most
                  effectively utilize neuronal models in these novel
                  contexts, we need to develop design rules for
                  neuronal systems that relate how model design
                  affects overall system performance. In this paper
                  and a companion article, we investigate how the
                  complexity of a neural model affects the performance
                  of a two-cell oscillator built from the model. In
                  this paper, we create a series of related neuron
                  models with different mathematical
                  complexity. Starting with a complex mechanistic
                  model of a bursting neuron, we use a variety of
                  techniques to create a series of simplified neuron
                  models. These three reduced models produce bursting
                  activity that is qualitatively very similar to the
                  original model. In the following companion article,
                  we investigate the functional performance of
                  oscillators built from these models.},

  abstract     = {The presence of subgroups in vomeronasal sensory
                  neurons has been known in various animals. To
                  elucidate possible functional subdivisions in the
                  guinea-pig accessory olfactory bulb, the combined
                  studies with GTP-binding protein
                  immunohistochemistry, electrophysiological and
                  optical recordings were carried out. Gi2 alpha and
                  Go alpha proteins were immunohistochemically
                  localized, respectively, in the anterior and
                  posterior regions of the vomeronasal nerve and
                  glomerular layers, indicating that the guinea-pig
                  accessory olfactory bulb receives at least two
                  different inputs. This suggests that an anatomical
                  boundary exists in these two layers. A mapping study
                  of field potentials in sagittal slice preparations
                  demonstrated that stimulation of the anterior
                  vomeronasal nerve layer elicited field potentials
                  with weak oscillatory responses exclusively in the
                  anterior region of the external plexiform layer,
                  whereas shocks to the posterior vomeronasal nerve
                  layer provoked distinct oscillatory responses within
                  the posterior one. The damping factors of
                  oscillations in the anterior and posterior regions
                  were 0.064+/-0.028 and 0.025+/-0.014,
                  respectively. These electrophysiological results
                  suggest that the accessory olfactory bulb consists
                  of two functionally different
                  subdivisions. Real-time optical imaging showed that
                  anterior vomeronasal nerve layer shocks produced
                  neural activity which spread horizontally from
                  anterior to posterior only within the anterior
                  region of the external plexiform and mitral cell
                  layers, whereas shocks to the posterior vomeronasal
                  nerve layer evoked periodic neural activity which
                  spread horizontally from posterior to anterior only
                  within the posterior region. Furthermore, the most
                  posterior extent of the optical response evoked in
                  the anterior region immediately adjoined the most
                  anterior extent of that evoked in the posterior
                  region. The maximal distance of signal propagation
                  in the granule cell layer corresponded to that in
                  the overlying external plexiform and mitral cell
                  layers, indicating that the granule cell layer also
                  has a similar boundary. Thus, these optical imaging
                  studies not only demonstrated a precise boundary in
                  each layer of the accessory olfactory bulb, which
                  was positioned right beneath the boundary defined by
                  GTP-binding protein immunohistochemistry, but also
                  confirmed the observations from electrophysiological
                  mapping that evoked field potentials are
                  independently distributed in each of two
                  subdivisions. The presence of the functional
                  subdivision in each layer leads us to conclude that
                  the accessory olfactory bulb in the guinea-pig is
                  distinctly segregated into the anterior and
                  posterior subdivisions, and to suggest that there
                  are at least two different input output pathways in
                  the vomeronasal system.},

  abstract     = {* 1The K+ currents of spinal neurons acutely
                  dissociated from Xenopus larvae were studied and
                  compared with those of neurons dissociated from
                  Xenopus embryos.  * 2The density of total outward
                  current in the larval and embryonic neurons remained
                  the same from stage 37/38 to stage 42.  * 3Almost
                  all neurons at stage 42 expressed a fast activating
                  Ca2+-dependent K+ current (IKCa) that was largely
                  absent from embryonic neurons. Whereas IKCa became
                  larger and more prevalent during development, the
                  delayed rectifier K+ currents were down-regulated.
                  * 4About 53\% of IKCa was selectively blocked by
                  iberiotoxin which had no effect on the delayed
                  rectifier K+ currents or the K+ currents of
                  embryonic neurons.  * 5The firing properties of
                  neurons isolated from embryos were unchanged by
                  iberiotoxin. However, the toxin greatly increased
                  the frequency of firing in larval neurons.  *
                  6Iberiotoxin extended the duration of ventral root
                  bursts during fictive swimming in larvae at stages
                  41 and 42 but had no effect at stage 40. The
                  progressive expression of IKCa thus contributed to
                  burst termination.  * 7We have found that changes in
                  expression of outward current closely correlate with
                  the maturation of the motor pattern during
                  development. At a time when the motor pattern has a
                  need for a burst-terminating mechanism, the larval
                  neurons express a channel with properties
                  appropriate for such a role.},

                  of information over short periods of
                  time. Individual capacity of working memory is
                  associated with the integrity of white matter in the
                  frontoparietal regions. It is unknown to what extent
                  the integrity of white matter underlying the working
                  memory system is plastic. Using voxel-based analysis
                  (VBA) of fractional anisotropy (FA) measures of
                  fiber tracts, we investigated the effect of working
                  memory training on structural connectivity in an
                  interventional study. The amount of working memory
                  training correlated with increased FA in the white
                  matter regions adjacent to the intraparietal sulcus

                  training-induced plasticity in regions that are
                  thought to be critical in working memory. As changes
                  in myelination lead to FA changes in diffusion
                  tensor imaging, a possible mechanism for the
                  observed FA change is increased myelination after
                  training. Observed structural changes may underlie
                  previously reported improvement of working memory
                  capacity, improvement of other cognitive functions,

                  network level of a modulation of intrinsic membrane
                  properties. The role calcium-dependent potassium
                  channels, KCa, in the lamprey locomotor system has
                  been investigated extensively. Earlier experimental
                  studies have shown that apamin, which affects one
                  type of KCa, increases the cycle duration of the
                  locomotor network, due to effects on the burst
                  termination. The effects of apamin were here larger
                  when the network had a low level of activity (burst
                  frequency 0.5 to 1 Hz) as compared to a higher rate
                  ($>$2 Hz). By using a previously developed
                  simulation model based on the lamprey locomotor
                  network, we show that the model could account for
                  the frequency dependence of the apamin modulation,
                  if only the KCa conductance activated by Ca2+
                  entering during the action potential was altered and
                  not the KCa conductance activated by Ca2+ entering
                  through NMDA channels. The present simulation model
                  of the spinal network in the lamprey can thus
                  account for earlier experimental results with apamin
                  on the network and cellular level that previously
                  appeared enigmatic.},

                  introductory text provides an exhaustive survey of
                  ordinary differential equations \textemdash{}
                  equations which express the relationship between
                  variables and their derivatives. In a disarmingly
                  simple, step-by-step style that never sacrifices
                  mathematical rigor, the authors \textemdash{} Morris
                  Tenenbaum of Cornell University, and Harry Pollard
                  of Purdue University \textemdash{} introduce and
                  explain complex, critically-important concepts to
                  undergraduate students of mathematics, engineering
                  and the sciences. The book begins with a section
                  that examines the origin of differential equations,
                  defines basic terms and outlines the general
                  solution of a differential equation-the solution
                  that actually contains every solution of such an
                  equation. Subsequent sections deal with such
                  subjects as: integrating factors; dilution and
                  accretion problems; the algebra of complex numbers;
                  the linearization of first order systems; Laplace
                  Transforms; Newton's Interpolation Formulas; and
                  Picard's Method of Successive Approximations. The
                  book contains two exceptional chapters: one on
                  series methods of solving differential equations,
                  the second on numerical methods of solving
                  differential equations. The first includes a
                  discussion of the Legendre Differential Equation,
                  Legendre Functions, Legendre Polynomials, the Bessel
                  Differential Equation, and the Laguerre Differential
                  Equation. Throughout the book, every term is clearly
                  defined and every theorem lucidly and thoroughly
                  analyzed, and there is an admirable balance between
                  the theory of differential equations and their
                  application. An abundance of solved problems and
                  practice exercises enhances the value of Ordinary
                  Differential Equations as a classroom text for
                  undergraduate students and teaching
                  professionals. The book concludes with an in-depth
                  examination of existence and uniqueness theorems
                  about a variety of differential equations, as well
                  as an introduction to the theory of determinants and

                  have demonstrated that during the transition from

                  a conductance-based computational network model of
                  the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of
                  the globus pallidus in the indirect pathway of the
                  basal ganglia. Computer simulations and analysis of
                  this model illuminate the roles of the coupling
                  architecture of the network, and associated synaptic
                  conductances, in modulating the activity patterns
                  displayed by this network. Depending on the
                  relationships of these coupling parameters, the
                  network can support three general classes of
                  sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating
                  waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little
                  regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can
                  occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We
                  characterize the mechanisms underlying these
                  rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on
                  details such as spiking frequency and wave
                  speed. These results suggest that the

                  naturally emerges in two-cell neuronal networks
                  featuring coupling by synaptic inhibition. We
                  introduce a one-dimensional map that captures the
                  irregular activity occurring in our simulations of
                  conductance-based differential equations and

                  connections formed as neuronal networks develop and
                  can simple rules account for the formation of
                  functioning circuits? These questions are assessed
                  in the spinal circuits controlling swimming in
                  hatchling frog tadpoles. This is possible because
                  detailed information is now available on the
                  identity and synaptic connections of the main types
                  of neuron. Results: The probabilities of synapses
                  between 7 types of identified spinal neuron were
                  measured directly by making electrical recordings
                  from 500 pairs of neurons. For the same neuron
                  types, the dorso-ventral distributions of axons and
                  dendrites were measured and then used to calculate
                  the probabilities that axons would encounter
                  particular dendrites and so potentially form
                  synaptic connections. Surprisingly, synapses were
                  found between all types of neuron but contact
                  probabilities could be predicted simply by the
                  anatomical overlap of their axons and
                  dendrites. These results suggested that synapse
                  formation may not require axons to recognise
                  specific, correct dendrites. To test the
                  plausibility of simpler hypotheses, we first made
                  computational models that were able to generate
                  longitudinal axon growth paths and reproduce the
                  axon distribution patterns and synaptic contact
                  probabilities found in the spinal cord. To test if
                  probabilistic rules could produce functioning spinal
                  networks, we then made realistic computational
                  models of spinal cord neurons, giving them
                  established cell-specific properties and connecting
                  them into networks using the contact probabilities
                  we had determined. A majority of these networks
                  produced robust swimming activity. Conclusion:
                  Simple factors such as morphogen gradients
                  controlling dorso-ventral soma, dendrite and axon
                  positions may sufficiently constrain the synaptic
                  connections made between different types of neuron
                  as the spinal cord first develops and allow
                  functional networks to form. Our analysis implies
                  that detailed cellular recognition between spinal
                  neuron types may not be necessary for the reliable
                  formation of functional networks to generate early
                  behaviour like swimming.},

  abstract     = {Summary Neuronal processing is classically
                  conceptualized as~dendritic input, somatic
                  integration, and axonal output. The axon initial
                  segment, the proposed site of action potential
                  generation, usually emanates directly from the
                  soma. However, we found that axons of hippocampal
                  pyramidal cells frequently derive from a basal
                  dendrite rather than from the soma. This morphology
                  is particularly enriched in central CA1, the
                  principal hippocampal output area. Multiphoton
                  glutamate uncaging revealed that input onto the
                  axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs) was more efficient in
                  eliciting action potential output than input onto
                  regular basal dendrites. First, synaptic input onto
                  AcDs generates action potentials with lower
                  activation thresholds compared with regular
                  dendrites. Second, AcDs are intrinsically more
                  excitable, generating dendritic spikes with higher
                  probability and greater strength. Thus,
                  axon-carrying dendrites constitute a privileged
                  channel for excitatory synaptic input in a subset of
                  cortical pyramidal cells.  Video Abstract},

  abstract     = {Based on a detailed morphology ``Full Model'' of a
                  leech heart interneuron, we previously developed a
                  computationally efficient, morphologically inspired
                  ``Reduced Model'' to expedite tuning the model to
                  produce endogenous bursting and alternating bursting
                  when configured as a half-center oscillator (paired
                  with reciprocally inhibitory synapses). To find
                  conductance density distributions that produce
                  endogenous bursting, we implemented a genetic
                  algorithm automated parameter search. With multiple
                  searches, we found eight parameter sets that
                  produced endogenous bursting in the Reduced
                  Model. When these parameter sets were applied to the
                  Full Model, all produced endogenous bursting,
                  although when the simulation time was extended from
                  80 to 300 s, only four parameter sets produced
                  sustained bursting in the Reduced Models. All
                  parameter sets produced alternating half-center
                  bursting in the Reduced and Full Models throughout
                  the entire 300 s. When conductance amplitudes were
                  systematically varied for each of the four sustained
                  burster sets, the effects on bursting activity
                  differed, both for the same parameter set in the
                  Reduced and Full Models and for different parameter
                  sets with the same level of morphological
                  detail. This implies that morphological detail can
                  affect burst activity and that these parameter sets
                  may represent different mechanisms for burst
                  generation and/or regulation. We also tested the
                  models with parameter variations that correspond to
                  experimental manipulations. We conclude that,
                  whereas similar output can be achieved with multiple
                  different parameter sets, perturbations such as
                  conductance variations can highlight
                  differences. Additionally, this work demonstrates
                  both the utility and limitations of using simplified
                  models to represent more morphologically accurate
                  models.},

  abstract     = {Neurons in vitro and in vivo have epochs of bursting
                  or ``up state'' activity during which firing rates
                  are dramatically elevated. Various methods of
                  detecting bursts in extracellular spike trains have
                  appeared in the literature, the most widely used
                  apparently being Poisson Surprise (PS). A natural
                  description of the phenomenon assumes (1) there are
                  two hidden states, which we label ``burst'' and
                  ``non-burst,'' (2) the neuron evolves
                  stochastically, switching at random between these
                  two states, and (3) within each state the spike
                  train follows a time-homogeneous point process. If
                  in (2) the transitions from non-burst to burst and
                  burst to non-burst states are memoryless, this
                  becomes a hidden Markov model (HMM). For HMMs, the
                  state transitions follow exponential distributions,
                  and are highly irregular. Because observed bursting
                  may in some cases be fairly
                  regular\textemdash{}exhibiting inter-burst intervals
                  with small variation\textemdash{}we relaxed this
                  assumption. When more general probability
                  distributions are used to describe the state
                  transitions the two-state point process model
                  becomes a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We
                  developed an efficient Bayesian computational scheme
                  to fit HSMMs to spike train data. Numerical
                  simulations indicate the method can perform well,
                  sometimes yielding very different results than those
                  based on PS.},

                  generates a bursting rhythm, which underlies the
                  inspiratory phase of respiration. In some of these
                  neurons, bursting persists even when synaptic
                  coupling in the network is blocked and respiratory
                  rhythmic discharge stops. Bursting in inspiratory
                  neurons has been extensively studied, and two
                  classes of bursting neurons have been identified,
                  with bursting mechanism depends on either persistent

                  modeled via inactivation of a persistent sodium
                  current, whereas bursting in the dendritic

  abstract     = {Synaptic and endogenous pacemaker properties have
                  been hypothesized as principal cellular mechanisms
                  for respiratory rhythm generation. This rhythmic
                  activity is thought to originate in the
                  pre-B{\"o}tzinger complex, an area that can generate
                  fictive respiration when isolated in brainstem slice
                  preparations of mice. In slice preparations,
                  external potassium concentration ([K+]o) is
                  typically elevated from 3 to 8 mm to induce rhythmic
                  population activity. However, elevated [K+]o may not
                  simply depolarize respiratory neurons but also
                  change rhythm-generating mechanisms by inducing or
                  altering pacemaker properties. To test this, we
                  examined the membrane potential (V m) of
                  nonpacemaker neurons and endogenous bursting
                  properties of pacemaker neurons before and after
                  blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input
                  in 3 mm [K+]o artificial CSF (aCSF). Most pacemaker
                  neurons (82\%) ceased to burst in 3 mm [K+]o aCSF
                  after blockade of glutamatergic transmission. In all
                  of these, endogenous bursting was restored on
                  additional blockade of glycinergic and GABAergic
                  inhibition. Thus, bursting properties are suppressed
                  by endogenous synaptic inhibition, the level of
                  which may determine whether network rhythmicity is
                  generated in 3 mm(n = 12) or 8 mm (n= 40) [K+]o
                  aCSF. In 3 mm[K+]o aCSF, synaptically isolated
                  pacemaker neurons (n = 22) continued to burst over a
                  wide range of imposed V m. Furthermore, theV m of
                  synaptically isolated pacemaker neurons was not
                  significantly affected (p = 0.1; n = 10) when [K+]o
                  was changed from 8 to 3 mm, whereas isolated
                  nonpacemakers hyperpolarized (p $<$ 0.001; n =
                  14). We conclude that respiratory pacemaker neurons
                  possess membrane properties that stabilize their
                  bursting against changes in [K+]o and imposed
                  changes inV m.},

  abstract     = {The activity state of neuronal networks can be
                  characterized by the spatial-temporal grouping of
                  their action potentials given a sufficiently large
                  simultaneous recording sample. A sequence of action
                  potentials (spike train) often has high frequency
                  spike episodes that are generally called
                  bursts. However, bursts are difficult to quantify
                  and require operational definitions that reflect the
                  type of activity and the interest of the
                  experimenter. This paper presents a simple method
                  for defining bursts as strings of spikes with only
                  two parameters: a minimum number of spikes per burst
                  and a maximum interspike interval. These two values
                  represent a simple parameterization that is adequate
                  for the description of temporal grouping in spike
                  trains. Because this method has a minimal
                  computation time, it allows implementation of burst
                  analysis in real-time, including statistical changes
                  in burst variables, histograms of burst types, and

  abstract     = {An essential question raised after the observation
                  of highly variable bursting activity in individual
                  neurons of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is how
                  an assembly of such cells can cooperatively act to
                  produce regular signals to motor systems. It is well
                  known that some neurons in the lobster
                  stomatogastric ganglion have a highly irregular
                  spiking\textendash{}bursting behavior when they are
                  synaptically isolated from any connection in the
                  CPG. Experimental recordings show that periodic
                  stimuli on a single neuron can regulate its firing
                  activity. Other evidence demonstrates that specific
                  chemical and/or electrical synapses among neurons
                  also induce the regularization of the rhythms. In
                  this paper we present a modeling study in which a
                  slow subcellular dynamics, the exchange of calcium
                  between an intracellular store and the cytoplasm, is
                  responsible for the origin and control of the
                  irregular spiking\textendash{}bursting activity. We
                  show this in simulations of single cells under
                  periodic driving and in minimal networks where the
                  cooperative activity can induce
                  regularization. While often neglected in the
                  description of realistic neuron models, subcellular
                  processes with slow dynamics may play an important
                  role in information processing and short-term memory
                  of spiking\textendash{}bursting neurons.},

                  which was revealed either by removal of external
                  Ca2+ or by the addition of the Ca2+ channel blocker,
                  150 microM Cd2+. 2. The Ca(2+)-sensitive current was
                  very slow to activate and had a mean time constant
                  of activation of 437 ms at 0 mV. The current also
                  had very long tail currents which were blocked by
                  Cd2+. The rate of decay of the slowest component of
                  the Ca(2+)-dependent tail currents was insensitive
                  to membrane potential suggesting that the relaxation
                  of the Ca(2+)-dependent current may only be weakly
                  voltage dependent. 3. The reversal potential of the
                  Ca(2+)-sensitive tail currents depended on the
                  concentration of external K+ in a manner predicted
                  by the Nernst equation. Thus the Ca(2+)-sensitive
                  current was carried by K+. 4. The toxin apamin (10
                  nM to 2 microM) selectively blocked the
                  Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current without affecting
                  voltage-gated K+ currents. This current may be
                  analogous to a small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K+
                  (SK) current; however, unlike some SK currents, the
                  Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current was also sensitive to
                  500 microM tetraethylammonium chloride
                  (TEA). 5. Applications of 10 nM apamin to spinalized
                  embryos did not perturb the motor pattern for
                  swimming. However, the cycle periods over which the
                  locomotor rhythm generator could generate
                  appropriate motor activity were lengthened by about
                  10\% and the mean duration of swimming episodes was
                  increased by approximately 40\%. 6. We therefore
                  propose that the Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current plays
                  an important role in the self-termination of motor
                  activity.},

                  fictive locomotor activity in the isolated spinal
                  cord preparation of the lamprey, as well as
                  TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations in
                  many individual neurons. This inherent oscillatory
                  activity is shown to depend on a specific activation
                  of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. This
                  activation initiates voltage-dependent, magnesium-
                  requiring membrane potential bistability, presumably
                  due to a development of a region of negative slope
                  conductance in the current- voltage relation of the
                  neuron. When sodium ions were removed from the
                  bathing solution, oscillations disappeared, and the
                  membrane potential was maintained at a
                  hyperpolarized level, suggesting that the
                  depolarizing current during the oscillatory cycle is
                  mainly carried by sodium ions. Replacing Ca2+ with
                  Ba2+ also leads to a cessation of oscillatory
                  activity, with the membrane potential remaining at
                  the more depolarized level. This indicates an
                  involvement of a Ca2+-dependent K+ current during
                  the repolarization phase. These findings, together
                  with the voltage dependence, can account for the
                  main characteristics of the NMDA receptor-induced,
                  TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations. This
                  oscillatory behavior has been demonstrated in
                  motoneurons and in several interneurons including CC
                  interneurons but has not been found in edge cells,
                  dorsal cells, or lateral interneurons. The
                  possibility that inherent oscillatory membrane
                  properties may contribute to the activity pattern
                  during fictive locomotion was investigated in
                  experiments with intracellular current injection in
                  the absence of TTX. The stimulation effects obtained
                  required the presence of magnesium ions and were
                  analogous to the stimulation effects seen during
                  oscillations after TTX blockade. Together with
                  similarities in, for instance, frequency and
                  amplitude between the locomotor oscillatory activity
                  and the TTX-resistant oscillations, the results are
                  compatible with an involvement of inherent,
                  oscillatory membrane properties during fictive
                  locomotion in the lamprey spinal cord.},

                  neurons in the neocortex, which fire fast rhythmic
                  bursts in the gamma frequency range ($\sim$40 Hz) in
                  response to stimulation [Gray C. M. and McCormick
                  D. A. (1996) Science274, 109\textendash{}113]. The
                  bursting mechanism involves a ``ping-pong''
                  interplay between soma-to-dendrite back propagation
                  of action potentials and an afterdepolarization
                  generated by a persistent dendritic Na+ current and
                  a somatic Na+ window current. The oscillation period
                  is primarily determined by a slowly inactivating K+
                  channel and passive membrane properties. The model
                  behavior is compared quantitatively with the
                  experimental data. It is shown that the cholinergic
                  muscarinic receptor activation can transform the
                  model cell's firing pattern from tonic spiking to
                  rapid bursting, as a possible pathway for
                  acetylcholine to promote 40-Hz oscillations in the
                  visual cortex. To explore possible functions of fast
                  burst firing in the neocortex, a hypothetical neural
                  pair is simulated, where a chattering cell is
                  presynaptic to an inhibitory interneuron via
                  stochastic synapses. For this purpose, we use a
                  synapse model endowed with a low release
                  probability, short-term facilitation and vesicle
                  depletion. This synapse model reproduces the
                  behavior of certain neocortical
                  pyramid-to-interneuron synapses [Thomson A. M.et
                  al. (1993) Neuroscience54, 347\textendash{}360]. We
                  showed that the burstiness of cell firing is
                  required for the rhythmicity to be reliably
                  transmitted to the postsynaptic cell via unreliable
                  synapses, and that fast burst firing of chattering
                  neurons can provide an exceptionally powerful drive
                  for recruiting feedback inhibition in cortical
                  circuits.  From these results, we propose that the
                  fast rhythmic burst firing of neocortical chattering
                  neurons is generated by a calcium-independent ionic
                  mechanism. Our simulation results on the neural pair
                  highlight the importance of characterizing the
                  short-term plasticity of the synaptic connections
                  made by chattering cells, in order to understand
                  their putative pacemaker role in synchronized gamma

                  extensively as a model system for investigating the
                  networks underlying vertebrate motor behavior. The
                  locomotor networks can be activated by application
                  of glutamate agonists, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic
                  acid (NMDA), to the isolated spinal cord
                  preparation. Many spinal neurons are capable of
                  generating pacemaker-like membrane potential
                  oscillations upon activation of NMDA
                  receptors. These oscillations rely on the
                  voltage-dependent properties of NMDA receptors in
                  interaction with voltage-dependent potassium and
                  calcium-dependent potassium (KCa) channels, as well
                  as low voltage-activated calcium channels. Upon
                  membrane depolarization, influx of calcium will
                  activate KCa channels, which in turn, will
                  contribute to repolarization and termination of the
                  depolarized phase. The appearance of the
                  NMDA-induced oscillations varies markedly between
                  spinal cord preparations; they may either have a
                  pronounced, depolarized plateau phase or be
                  characterized by a short-lasting depolarization
                  lasting approximately 200\textendash{}300 ms without
                  a plateau. Both types of oscillations increase in
                  frequency with increased concentrations of
                  NMDA. Here, we characterize these two types of
                  membrane potential oscillations and show that they
                  depend on the level of endogenous release of 5-HT in
                  the spinal cord preparations. In the lamprey, 5-HT
                  acts to block voltage-dependent calcium channels and
                  will thereby modulate the activity of KCa
                  channels. When 5-HT antagonists were administered,
                  the plateau-like oscillations were converted to the
                  second type of oscillations lacking a plateau
                  phase. Conversely, plateau-like oscillations can be
                  induced or prolonged by 5-HT agonists. These
                  properties are most likely of significance for the
                  modulatory action of 5-HT on the spinal networks for
                  locomotion.},

                  increasing order. We generalize this function by
                  allowing the weights to be an arbitrary
                  non-decreasing sequence of numbers. This results in
                  a class of generalized Gini relative inequality
                  indices and a class of generalized Gini absolute
                  inequality indices. An axiomatic characterization of
                  the latter class is also provided.},

  abstract     = {The conditions under which a noninactivating sodium
                  current and either a potassium current or an
                  inwardly rectifying cation current can generate
                  subthreshold oscillations were analyzed using
                  nonlinear dynamical techniques applied to a neuronal
                  model consisting of two differential
                  equations. Mathematical descriptions of the membrane
                  currents were derived using voltage-clamp data
                  collected from entorhinal cortical neurons. A
                  bifurcation analysis was performed using applied
                  current as the control parameter to map the range of
                  magnitudes of the sodium, potassium/cation, and
                  leakage conductances over which subthreshold
                  oscillations exist. The threshold of the
                  potassium/cation current was an important
                  determinant of the robustness of oscillatory
                  behavior. The activation time constant of the
                  potassium/cation current largely determined the
                  frequency range of emergent oscillations. This
                  result implicates the slow inward rectifier or an as
                  yet undescribed slow outward current in entorhinal
                  cortical oscillations; the latter explanation, while
                  more speculative, is more consistent with the
                  pharmacological properties of subthreshold
                  oscillations and gives oscillations over a larger
                  current range. The shallowness of the sodium
                  activation curve confined emergent oscillations to
                  rise gradually rather than abruptly and extended the
                  current range over which the model oscillated.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear dynamics of lasers has been a lively
                  theoretical and experimental field since the
                  invention of the laser in 1960. Its focus in the
                  last two decades have been instabilities in widely
                  used semiconductor lasers. Nonlinear studies of
                  laser systems contributed to the field of dynamical
                  systems with general phenomena including chaos,
                  (chaotic) synchronization of coupled oscillators,
                  competition, excitability, delay-induced
                  instabilities, unfolding of high-codimension
                  bifurcations, bifurcation cascades, and spatial
                  patterns; see [1, 28, 30, 36, 51, 63] for general
                  reading and further references. These studies also
                  deepened the understanding of nonlinear phenomena
                  that are important for technological applications,
                  e.g. external-modulation response of semiconductor
                  lasers for faster Internet connections
                  [57].Furthermore, nonlinear analysis of laser
                  systems stimulated and helped to validate the
                  feasibility of novel, chaos-based applications
                  including secure communication schemes [4, 50],
                  chaotic radars [34], and instability-based laser
                  sensors [56].},
